For our Cloud customers, we are thrilled to introduce Cloud UI, our initial separate UI release, which includes the Pricing Calendar. Cloud UI is our standalone application layer that decouples frontend code from the nopCommerce backend.
Separating the UI from the API infrastructure provides the following benefits:
More frequent, lower-risk frontend-only releases
Creation of distinct, releasable units
Shift toward a modern application server framework
Improved page load performance over time as more of the site is migrated to this framework
Cloud UI for Commerce also offers the following UI features and enhancements:

Airline passengers have been programmed to check-in 24 hours prior to their flights for years now. This allows the airline to capture information on the guest, saves time at the airport, and gives travelers peace of mind that their experience at the airport will be smooth. Aspenware Arrival provides this experience for guests coming to ski and ride at the resort. Guests can check in prior to arriving at the resort.

Resort Tools reduces time spent waiting in line for guests and time spent by resort staff checking guests in across your resort.
Overview
Resort Tools encompasses two products that can be used in one of two ways or in tandem for the optimal onsite guest experience. The two offerings are as follows:
Resort Tools - Kiosk
Resort Tools - Kiosk
is designed for guests to complete the required information at a resort kiosk Our user-facing kiosk is designed to capture required information in your rental stores, pass offices and lesson locations. The streamlined user flow is designed for ease of use and accurate customer profiles. Resorts mitigate risk with the careful completion and collection of required documents.
All guests at a particular location will be guided through the same process, which is optimized for that location. The product can operate without an internet connection if configured for offline use. Guests can use a fast-flow option with pre-filled information, but personalization based on guest data and order details is unavailable. If personalization is important,
Aspenware Arrival
may be a better option. To use Resort Tools - Kiosk, a Resort Tools or Aspenware Arrival license is required.

Resort Tools - Waiver Tablets (Guest Check-In) enables guests to complete required information onsite. This tool enables the signing of waivers, the ability to email waivers to non-present attendees, the option to opt into marketing communications, and the ability to capture and upload a photo.

Ongoing Support and Maintenance
This solution supports the use of the SKIDATA Skiosk to print media from an RTP order or sales transaction.  Sales that contain deferred printable media from RTP are uploaded to SKIDATA’s SWEB tool which can then be printed on the Skiosk.  Once printed, SKIDATA sends the RFID back to RTP and marks the media as printed.  The media can then be used for validation in RTP.
Solution Overview
There are 4 main aspects to this solution.  1) SKIDATA DTA/SWEB, 2) Unity Contractor Service, 3) Unity DTA Jobs, and 4) RTP.
Open image-20230425-162904.png
SKIDATA DTA/SWEB
SKIDATA provides access to SWEB during the implementation and will also provide training on the tool.  Typically SWEB is accessed often during the initial implementation phase to verify interfaced products and orders but then less after go-live.  The interface between Aspenware and SKIDATA only uses a small portion of SWEB which is also used with SKIDATAs POS and parking system.
SKIDTA Skiosks
This is the hardware that prints RFID cards (shown above).
DTA
This is the name of the interface used by a 3rd party system to interact with SKIDATA’s system.
SWEB
SWEB is the name of the user interface used by the SKIDATA Skiosks and can be used to view interfaced products and orders.  The printing template the Skiosks use is also defined in SWEB.
Open image-20230425-181722.png
Unity Contactor Service
The Unity Contractor Service is an Aspenware-created Windows IIS application that is installed locally at the resort. The application is used for for 2 purposes which are to create products in SKIDATA’s SWEB application (via the catalog import function) and to upload the RFID from the Skiosk back into RTP and to mark the media as printed.
An RTP Client Code is defined in the SKIDATA SWEB tool which is used in the catalog import process to lookup products in RTP that are eligible to be printed on the Skoisk.  A product is created in SWEB for each RTP product and a mapping is automatically defined to the RTP product header code.  Only products that are interfaced to SWEB through the catalog import process are then eligible to printed on the Skiosks.  Once printed, SWEB sends the RFID back to the Unity Contractor Service where it is uploaded into RTP’s ExternalAccessMap table and the media is marked as printed in the TransactionProductOutput table.
Unity DTA Jobs
The Unity DTA Jobs service is also an Aspenware-created Windows IIS application that is installed locally at the resort.  This application polls RTP’s TransactionProductOutput table every minute for new records.  Only transactions with products that have previously been interfaced to SKIDATA’s SWEB tool (via the catalog import) will be picked up by the service and sent to SKIDATA to create an order.  An Order is created in SWEB with a reference to the RTP Sales Transaction ID, Order ID or External Order ID which is used to retrieve the order and print (usually from a QR or barcode).
RTP
RTP sales transactions and fulfilled orders that contain deferred media of season pass and access products are eligible to be printed on the Skiosks.  As mentioned previously, the products must first be included in the catalog import process and interfaced to SWEB before a sales transaction or fulfilled order containing deferred media will be created in SWEB as an Order.
RTP Client Code
The RTP Client Code defined in SWEB will be used by the catalog import to lookup which products meet the criteria to be included in the import process.
Products must be priced in RTP for the day the catalog import runs.
An existing RTP Client Code can be used or a new one can be created.  The Sale Location assigned to the Client in RTP can also be an existing sale location or a new one dedicated to a new Skiosk Location.  The benefit of using a new sale location is that products could be priced for all dates.  If products are only priced for part of the year, it is likely multiple catalog imports will need to be performed in order to interface those products to SWEB making transactions and orders that contain these products eligible to be printed on the Skiosks.  If products are available all season, then it is possible only a single catalog import will need to be run at the beginning of the season.
The Client Code will also be uploaded into several RTP tables as the client code that printed the media (i.e. TransactionProductOutput.OutputClientCode).
Detailed Setup Guide
The following instructions detail the setup steps for using the SKIDATA Skiosk to print media from an RTP order or sales transaction.
Set Up SWEB Contractor
Import SWEB Catalog
Configure SWEB Print Mask (Media Template)
Install Aspenware IIS Application
Test UnityDTAJobs Install
Trigger Sending of RTP Transactions to SKIDATA/SWEB
Select Testing Method
Add Rules to Product Header Codes
Go Live
1. Set Up SWEB Contractor
The Unity Contractor Service URL is define in SWEB which is where SKIDATA will configure a Contractor entry. Aspenware will provide the URL to the Unity Contractor Service once it is setup or will add the URL to SWEB.  This can be found in SWEB in Sales Management / Tenants / Contractors.
Following is an example from Aspenware’s test environment.
Edit the Contractor entry and then navigate to the Contractor System tab to define the URL.

2. Click ‘Check Connectivity’ to test the connection from SKIDATA’s SWEB tool to the Unity Contractor Service installed locally at the resort.  The URL format is below but will differ for each install =
https://servername.com/UnityContractorService/ContractorService.svc
Open image-20230425-203735.png
Open image-20230502-153641.png
2. Import SWEB Catalog
SKIDATA will configure portions of SWEB prior to the first catalog import.  The catalog import can be found in SWEB in Sales Management > Configuration > Catalogs and there is typically only one entry created for the resort.  The RTP Client Code that will be used to lookup products in RTP is defined in the External ID field (see below).  At least one catalog import will need to be completed prior to any attempt to print from the Skiosks.
Open image-20230425-202054.png
To start the catalog import, click the
Import
button along the top ribbon. Then click
Start Import
.
Open image-20230425-202607.png
2. The import process only takes a few seconds.  To view the products imported, click the Products button along the top ribbon.
Open image-20230425-202713.png
3. If the import was successful, products will show in the list.  Use the gear/settings icon to show the External Id column which shows the RTP Product Header code.
Open image-20230425-202911.png
3. Configure SWEB Print Mask (Media Template)
The catalog import also configures a Print Mask in SWEB which is the media template that prints when a Skiosk order is fulfilled.  This is located in Sales Management > Configuration > Print Masks.  Each time the catalog imports runs, the print mask gets set back to the default which some customers do not use.
It is recommended to define the Print Mask during testing and then to export the template from SWEB and then re-import after each catalog import.
The default template pulls a description from one of the Unity Contractor Service configuration files so this could be used to define a short text line on the template (e.g., Winter 22-23).  Some customers use this and therefore need to remember to update the configuration file after each season.  Each time the configuration file is updated, a catalog import will need to be performed to add the new descriptions to SWEB.  The text is located in the web.config file in the DTA ticketText field.  Additional information can be found on this in the install section of this guide.
Open image-20230425-210309.png
Double click the entry above to edit the template.
Open image-20230425-211351.png
2. To export the template, click
Miscellaneous
in the upper right corner and then the
Export
button.  This will download a JSON file that can be used to import the template using the same method after the next catalog import.
Open image-20230425-211446.png
3. To import, click the
Import Template
button.
Open image-20230425-211609.png
4. Install Aspenware IIS Application
Aspenware will perform 2 installations on Unity in conjunction with this implementation.
Install Unity Contractor Service
Aspenware will install the Unity Contractor Service on a server at the resort that is accessible to the SKIDATA web services.  SKIDATA will provide the IP range of the traffic so that the server can be locked down.  The Unity Contractor Service is an IIS application that is accessed by SKIDATA for the catalog import function and to upload printed RFID’s to RTP.
The following config/json files contain all the configuration values needed for the service.
Rtp-config.json
– contains all RTP configuration values
SalesChannelCode:
Sales channel used for the product catalog import.  Products need to be priced for the day the catalog imports runs and to have output added in RTP for the sales channel defined.
UserID
: This must be a valid user with a valid UserSession.SessionToken in RTP.  This user will be the OperatorID that printed the media in several RTP database tables.
Database Connection string (server, db, SQL user)
: Aspenware will create a new SQL Role and User and the Role needs to have privileges to the following tables.  Aspenware can configure this in SSMS or provide a script.
GRANT SELECT ON  [dbo].[TransactionProductOutput] TO [awdtarole]
GRANT UPDATE ON  [dbo].[TransactionProductOutput] TO [awdtarole]
GRANT SELECT ON  [dbo].[TransactionLineOriginalTransactionLine] TO [awdtarole]

: Sale location used for the product catalog import.
AuditLocationCod
e: Not used but set to the same location code above.
Web.config
– contains additional setup data
Skiosks:
Defines mapping for SKIDATA Skiosk and RTP Client code.  This client code will be updated in RTP’s TransactionProductOutput.OutputClientCode column as the client that printed the output and shows in various places in RTP.  Currently on a single mapping is supported by SKIDATA.  Define the SKIDATA Sales Channel name to map to the RTP client code in this section.
Open image-20230502-153258.png
ticketText:
Text data is imported during catalog import to SWEB/Print Mask, ‘Text Print Mask Item 1’. If text is changed directly in SWEB, data will be overwritten with text defined in web.config in next catalog import.  If this media element is not added to the Print Mask in SWEB, there is no need to update this from season to season.
priceCategoryName:
Text data is imported during catalog import to SWEB/Price Category.  This description does not show during fulfillment but does show in SKIDATA admin.  Typically this description is set to match the same description of ticketText above.
seasonStartDate
&
seasonEndDate:
Dates are imported during catalog import to SWEB/Time Periods.  Aspenware recommends defining a large data range to avoid having to update each season since this data only shows in SKIDATA admin.
Open image-20230502-153419.png
Test the Unity Contractor Service install by entering the URL into a browser to verify a service page displays instead of an error page.
Example of URL:
https://aspenware.com/UnityContractorService/ContractorService.svc
Install Unity DTA Jobs
Aspenware will install the Unity DTA Jobs on a server at the resort that is accessible to the SKIDATA DTA web services.  SKIDATA will provide the IP range of the traffic so that the server can be locked down.  The Unity DTA Jobs is an IIS application that is used to look up transactions in RTP that have deferred output and to create orders in SKIDATA’s SWEB application.  Microsoft’s dotnet-hosting will also need to be installed on the server hosting the UnityDTAJobs application.
The UnityDTA Jobs service uses Hangfire which is a 3rd party product used to perform background processing in .NET and .NET Core applications.  Hangfire has several database tables that will also need to be deployed which are described below.
Install UnityDTAJobs database
Aspenware has scripts to install the UnityDTAJobs database which also include database tables for Hangfire.  These tables track which RTP transactions have been sent to SKIDATA/SWEB.  See below for screenshot of the tables included in the UnityDTAJobs database.
Open image-20230509-145344.png
Configure UnityDTAJobs
The following config/json files contain all the configuration values needed for the UnityDTAJobs service.
appsettings.json
Used to define database connection info to the Hangfire database tables.
DBConnString:
Define server and database hosting Hangfire database tables.
SyncReservationsBatchSize:
Defines the batch size for syncing RTP transactions to SWEB.  Default is 100.
SyncReturnsBatchSize:
Defines the batch size for syncing RTP return transactions to SWEB which cancel a previously created order.  Default is 100.
SyncPrintUpdatesBatchSize:
Defines the batch size for syncing print updates.  Default is 100.
EmailSettings:
Used to define SMTP email server info for alerts when an error occurs syncing RTP transactions or cancellations to SKIDATA.
skidata-config.json:
Defines SKIDATA production URL’s for the DTA interface.  Typically these do not change.
Client:
Define the SKIDATA DTA Tenant (from SWEB)
WorkingClientName:

5. Test UnityDTAJobs Install
Once installed, navigate to
http://localhost/UnityDTAJobs/hangfire/
in a browser on the machine hosting the application.  If the install was successful, the Hangfire Dashboard should show rather than an error page.  The Realtime Graph below shows the number of transactions processed and the History Graph shows the total uptime of the Hangfire service.
Open image-20230502-183550.png
6. Trigger Sending RTP Transactions to SKIDATA/SWEB
The UnityDTAJobs IIS application uses the dta.LastProcessedTransaction table to track the transactions that have already been sent to SKIDATA.  During the implementation, the ProcessDate will be set to a date in the past and will begin processing once the IIS application is started.  Once the date catches up to the current date, only new transactions containing deferred output will be processed moving forward.
Open image-20230502-184200.png
Every RTP transaction is reviewed by the service to see if there is any deferred output that meets the criteria to be sent to SKIDATA to create an order.  The criteria is that the product in the transaction has been previously interfaced to SKIDATA using the product catalog import and that the product has the Rule, ‘Skidata Print PUB’ added (See rules information below).  Each RTP transaction ID that meets the criteria, will be created in SWEB as an Order and the DTAOrderID will be recorded in the dta.Reservation table.
Open image-20230502-184402.png
The DTAOrderID will also be updated into RTP’s TransactionHeader table in the OfflineTransactionID field.
Open image-20230509-150511.png
Below shows an Order in SWEB created from RTP Transaction ID, 101525809.  If the order originated from an Aspenware online order, the ConfirmationNumber will be the RTP ExternalOrderID (i.e. PK12345).
Open image-20230502-184727.png
7. Select Testing Method
It is possible to point all the services to RTPOneTest to perform testing but it is easier to test against RTPOne prod instead.  The main issue with using RTPOneTest is that SKIDATA does not have a test system so it’s possible that an RTP TransactionID that was interfaced to SKIDATA/SWEB during testing from RTPOneTest will exist in RTPOne production as a real customer’s TransactionID.  The SKIDATA development team can clear out orders that were created during testing but using the method below against RTPOne prod is preferred for testing.
Below is an outline to perform initial testing without interfacing all RTP transactions to SKIDATA SWEB.
Set the dta.LastProcessedTransaction table to have a ProcessDate of today for all rows.
Recycle the UnityDTAJobs application pool (or start the service).
Create or clone an RTP Product Header that contains media output that has never been sold to a customer and add all three Skiosk related Rules (Unity Attribute - Age, Unity Attribute - Duration, and SkiData Print on PUB).
In SKIDATA SWEB, start the product catalog import and verify the new product shows up
If no product, review the SWEB DTA Transaction Logs for any errors.
If no errors in DTA Transaction Logs, review the UnityContractorService log
If no errors in the UnityContractorService log, start SQL trace to see call hitting RTP and manually run in SSMS.  This may reveal that the product does not meet the criteria to be interfaced (pricing, sales channel, sale location, etc).
In RTP, create a sales transaction and sell the product created in step 1 above.  Make sure to defer media during the sale.
In SWEB, make sure you see an Order show up within a minute or two.
If no order in SWEB, verify the UnityDTAJobs IIS application is running (verify the application pool is started).
If UnityDTAJobs is running, check error log.
If no errors, verify there is deferred output in RTP’s Deferred Output Tool.
Check the UnityDTAJobs table, dta.Reservation for the most recent entries to see if there are errors.
Create a barcode or QR code of the RTP TransactionID and attempt to use at Skiosk.
If nothing prints, re-verify the Transactions is in SWEB as an Order
If Order exists but nothing prints, ask SKIDATA to check the Skiosk log (which is located directly on the PC inside the Skiosk hardware.
If media prints, verify the RFID can be used to perform a search in RTP.
If RFID cannot be searched successfully in RTP, look for errors in the UnityContractorService log.
Repeat steps above for an RTP OrderID that is manually created and fulfilled in RTP and for an online order.
For an Order created directly in RTP, use the RTP OrderID as the barcode/QR code at the Skiosk.
For an online order, use the RTP ExternalOrderID as the barcode/QR code at the Skiosk.
8. Add Rules to Product Header Code(s)
Three Product Header Rules need to be added to any product that will be printed from the Skiosk.
IMPORTANT
:
DO NOT ADD THESE RULES UNTIL GO-LIVE.
More info on this can be found in the testing section of this document below.
Rule 1: Unity Attribute - Duration
Add Duration rule to Product Header Codes per the diagram and define a value of 1.
Open image-20230613-212505.png
Duration Rule
Rule 2: Unity Attribute - Age
Add Age rule to Product Header Codes per the diagram and define a value of 1.
Open image-20230613-212816.png
Age Rule
Rule 3: SkiData Print on PUB
Add SkiData Print on PUB Rule to Product Header Codes and define a value of TRUE.
Open image-20230613-213139.png
SKIDATA Print on PUB Rule
Open image-20230425-182209.png
Example of Rules added to PHC
Configure Product components to have Output and to Allow Deferral.
NOTE
: If after go-live, the resort realizes they did not add the three Rules to all products, the catalog import can be run again and the ProcessDate in the dta.LastProcessedTransaction can be set back to a date in the past.  The service will run and skip over any transaction it has already processed and only create orders in SWEB for transactions containing the new products.  This process will also take a few hours because every transaction is reviewed again by the service.
9. Go Live
Going live with the Skiosks means ensuring all products in RTP have the three rules added and then setting the ProcessDate in the dta.LastProcessedTransaction to a date in the past.  If the testing method above was followed, there should be no need to clear out data in the dta.Reservation table.
Stop the UnityDTAJobs application pool.
Ensure the 3 product header rules have been added to all products.
(SEE SECTION ABOVE)
Start the product catalog import in SWEB
Ask the resort to review the list of products.  If products are missing, ask the resort to add the three Rules to additional products and/or verify the product(s) are priced for ‘today'.
Repeat this step until the resort verifies all products are showing in SWEB.
Set the dta.LastProcessedTransaction table to have a ProcessDate in the past.  This should be the date of or right before the date they started selling media products for the season.
Start the UnityDTAJobs application pool.
Verify Orders are showing in SKIDATA SWEB.  This process can take a few hours depending on how far back the date goes and how many total transaction's the resort has.
To verify the initial load of Orders is complete, verify the ProcessDate for the Reservation column now shows today’s date.
Orders Creation in SWEB from RTP Sales Transactions
The Unity DTA Service is always running in the customer’s environment and is looking for new RTP transactions that contain deferred pass media and access output.  The products in these transactions need to have the Product Header Rule, SkiData Print On PUB and the products must currently be in SWEB from a catalog import.  If all these conditions are met, an Order gets created in SWEB which can be viewed in Sales Management > Monitoring > Orders (see below).  Once the Order is created in SWEB, it can then be printed from the Skiosk.
If an order or is cancelled in RTP or the fulfillment transactions has been returned, the order is then cancelled in SKIDATA/SWEB and cannot be printed.
The ‘Confirmation Number’ that appears in SWEB will be the RTP Sales Transaction ID if the deferred output is associated with an RTP sales transaction (completed directly in RTP), an RTP OrderID if the deferred output originated from an RTP order (completed directly in  RTP), or the ExternalOrderID if the sale originated from an Aspenware order (or any 3rd party processing orders into RTP).
This is the only value mapped to the SKIDATA Order and is the only value that can be used to find and print the order on the Skiosk.
In other words, for an Aspenware order, only the ExternalOrderID will get mapped to the Order in SWEB so only that value can be used to find the order and print the media from the Skiosk.  The RTP OrderID from Aspenware’s order cannot be used to find the order in SWEB.
Open image-20230425-223635.png
Ongoing Support and Maintenance
Depending on the products being printed on the Skiosks, additional product catalog imports may need to be run in the future.  Some resorts have very few products that haven’t changed from year to year so they may have only used the catalog import function during the initial implementation.  Resorts that are not bundling media with access on product headers may have very few media product headers and therefore very few interfaced products in SKIDATA/SWEB.  Resorts that bundle media and access may have dozens or hundreds of products interfaced to SKIDATA/SWEB.
The key thing to remember is that ‘todays’ date is used when the catalog import runs so if a resort does not have pricing setup until their opening date (i.e. 11/15/2024), then running the catalog import in October will not interface products to SKIDATA/SWEB.
As mentioned above, each time the catalog import is run in SWEB, the Print Mask resets back to the default so if the resort isn’t using the default, they will need to import the Print Mask file after each import.

The Aspenware Scanning application integrates into RTP’s access control system and can be used to process online and offline scans.  The application runs on handheld devices running Android kitkat up to version 11 of Android  (version 4.4 to version 11) which also have the DataWedge application (typically Zebra devices).  The devices connect via http or https to a server within the resorts internal local area network (LAN) running Aspenware’s Unity API.  Unity then communicates to the RTP database on the resorts LAN to verify scanning data and retrieve customer information.  The Unity API can be installed on the existing RTP application server or on another server located within the resort’s LAN.
The devices should be configured on the resorts local area network (LAN) and not a through a public wireless access point.  The devices should not have access to the internet, and it is the resorts responsibility to secure access to the scanner data and network traffic.  It is also recommended to disable Bluetooth and any cellular networks on the device.
There are 3 main aspects of this solution, 1) Android Device (AWScanning.apk), 2) Unity, and 3) RTP
Open image-20210512-191746.png
Settings Overview
The Aspenware Scanning application settings allow configuring the device behavior on the Login page and when scanning barcodes and reading RFID media cards.  The Login page can be configured to require scanning barcodes/RFID cards in order to sign-in as well as to require the user of a valid RTP UserID.  To gain access to the device settings, manually enter or scan a barcode of the word, ‘SETTINGS’.  This will automatically display the settings page on the device.

– determines whether user can manually select Access Location or if scanning a barcode is required to sign-in.  If set to Y, user must scan a valid AccessLocationCode from RTP (i.e barcode of 100, 110, 120, etc.)
Validate UserID
– determines whether username is a validated against RTP.  If enabled, a valid RTP UserID must be used to sign-in.
Force Login Scan
– determines whether a user must scan a pass media barcode or read an RFID card to sign-in.  If enabled, the RTP IPCode the pass belongs to must be added to a UserID in Admin/Security Administration/User in RTP:

Enable Add Customer ID
–enables functionality to allow operator to enter an RTP Customer ID (IPCode) when a certain RTP Access Error is returned as a scan result.  After entering customer ID, a new scan will be triggered that appends the {CustomerID} to the end of the previously scanned code.
Customer ID Scan Code –
click to enter a specific RTP Access Error ‘Error Message’ for the Enable Add Customer ID functionality.  This will be the only RTP Access Error that will trigger this functionality to allow an operator to enter a Customer ID (IPCode).  For example, ‘Bad Type’ is entered below so when this scan result is returned to the scanner, the ‘Add Customer ID’ option will display allowing the operator to enter an RTP IPCode.
Open image-20210512-192356.png
After scan occurs that returns this type, the Add Customer ID button appears:
Open image-20210512-192410.png
Which allows the operator to enter data which then gets appended to the previously scanned code and triggers a new scan:

Settings - Sound Settings
Sound settings define the sound generated for an Offline, Validate Only and Live Scan on the device.  Several sounds are delivered in each category and custom sounds can also be uploaded as of v1.14 of the app.  You can also define whether the device vibrates with each type of sound by checking the Vibrate checkbox.
For Live Scans, ‘Beep’ settings are used to map to valid and invalid scans from RTP Access Rule Product Type administration.  Settings for 1 and 3 Beeps are delivered with the device and map to a valid and invalid scan from RTP (3 is always an invalid scan in RTP).  Additional Beeps can be added which map to RTP’s Access Rule Product Type administration entries.  To add new Beeps, click the ‘New Setting’ button below and define an un-used Beep Count, Sound and Vibrate setting.  ‘4 Beeps’ has been added in the screen shot below.  After adding a new setting, you must click the ‘Save Settings’ button.
Open image-20210512-192832.png
To upload custom sounds
, place a .wav file in the devices Notification directory and select the custom sound file when defining new beeps or when editing the Offline and/or Validate Only settings.  For example, in the screen shots below, the ‘LightningSound.wav’ was uploaded to the device making it available to select through the app.

Settings - UHF Scan Settings
The UHF Scan Settings are configurable to allow adjusting the default behavior of the trigger, the transmit power of the device as well as the type of RFID’s populated into the device.
Open image-20230118-223307.png
Open image-20230118-223228.png
Trigger Mode
Barcode and RFID – allows the scanner to scan barcodes and read RFID tags.  When this is enabled, a barcode will be read first even if an RFID tag is in range.
RFID Only – only allows the scanner to scan RFID tags.
Use Max Transmit Power
– impacts the range of the scanner.  When enabled, the max range of the device will be used to scan RFID tags.  The max range for the Zebra MC3300 is 270 but this can differ per device.  This value is a numeric value that relates to a dBm value (decibels with reference to one milliwatt.)  The Zebra MC3300 has a range of 0-30 dBm so a value of 270 is equivalent to 30 dBM.
Transmit Power
– used when Use Max Transmit Power is disabled and defines transmit power other than the max value.  It is likely that this setting will need to be adjusted for each customer to find the optimal setting.  A lower value (i.e. 30 or 50) makes it easier to scan a specific tag while a higher value allows reading tags from greater distances.
Set Tag Population
– enabled or disabled.
Tag Population
– if Set Tag Population is enabled, this value defines the estimated number of tags that will be in range of the scanner.
Convert IDs to Base 32
– enabled or disabled
If enabled, Id is converted to Base 32 (i.e. 1OG000B706016C1N1R02)
If disabled, Id is Base 16 (i.e. E28068900000000163F009B9)
Use TID Memory Bank
– enables the application to use the value stored in the TID memory bank instead of the default tagId.  Typically ‘Convert IDs to Base 32’ is also selected when this is enabled.
Use EPC Memory Bank
– enables the application to use the value stored in the EPC memory bank instead of the default tagId.  Typically ‘Convert IDs to Base 32’ is also selected when this is enabled.
Login Page
Based on how Login Settings are defined, the login page will appear with various options.
Login page requiring Login Scan but not a Location Scan. User must manually define the Access Location Group and Access Location:
Open image-20210512-193236.png

For our Cloud customers, we are thrilled to introduce Cloud UI, our initial separate UI release, which includes the Pricing Calendar. Cloud UI is our standalone application layer that decouples frontend code from the nopCommerce backend.
Separating the UI from the API infrastructure provides the following benefits:
More frequent, lower-risk frontend-only releases
Creation of distinct, releasable units
Shift toward a modern application server framework
Improved page load performance over time as more of the site is migrated to this framework
Cloud UI for Commerce also offers the following UI features and enhancements:
Cloud UI Product Detail Page (PDP)

This feature is supported for
Aspenware Cloud customers.
This feature is not supported

Key Terms
Actions
Secure, tenant-specific, versioned functions written in Node.js that execute at certain points during the Auth0 runtime. Actions are used to customize and extend Auth0's capabilities with custom logic.

Software that relies on Auth0 for authentication and identity management. Auth0 supports single-page, regular web, native, and machine-to-machine applications.
Biometrics
Authentication process that allows the user to leverage FaceID or Fingerprint scanning.
Connection
Relationship between Auth0 and the sources of users for your applications. Examples include identity providers (such as Google or Active Directory), passwordless authentication methods, or user databases.
Custom Domain

Identity v3 (Powered by Auth0)
Aspenware Identity v3 (Powered by Auth0) marks a significant leap forward in secure, reliable, and modern identity features for our valued customers. In addition to the basic login & sign-up features, this product includes customer matching logic that will help reduce duplicate customers and account for any merging of customers in RTP.
As part of Aspenware’s ongoing commitment to safety and efficiency when rolling out new products and features, we will closely monitor and evaluate data in Auth0 and in Google Analytics. This ensures smooth operations and a seamless experience for all stakeholders.
What is Auth0?
Auth0
is an identity access management (IAM) provider. An IAM solution is a gatekeeper to the resources you provide to customers as web applications, APIs, etc, adding layers of authentication to secure your users’ digital identities and your product. The Auth0 identity platform supports regular web, mobile, or machine-to-machine apps.
The Identity v3 (Powered by Auth0) platform allows Aspenware to customize login services to fit your business, technology, and customer base.
Why Auth0?
Best in-class identity access management platform
Secure platform
Ability to easily extend into
SSO, social, biometrics, MFA, and passwordless which has been proven to increase conversion rates
Quick onboarding experience for customers.
Product Features
Sign in & Create Account
Your guests can utilize a standard login & create account flow using an email and password. The guest will be required to remember these credentials every season unless they decide to switch to other methods such as passwordless, which will be available in an upcoming release.
For any existing customer in RTP that signs in and has any missing information that is required upon sign up, the guest will be prompted with ‘complete your profile’ and be asked to input any missing data.  For example, if a customer/user exists in RTP with all fields except phone number, the guest will be shown
only
phone number field and be required to complete prior to signing in.
Note.
If a new guest signs up and doesn’t complete their profile here, RTP will be populated with a first and last name of the guests email address.  Due to RTP requirements and how auth0 works in conjunction, we must populate those fields so we can associated the auth0 account with an RTP customer ID.  Once the user completes the process of signing up, those fields will be replaced by their values they enter for first and last name.

Create User Account
Open Missing info complete profile - Mobile.svg
The user will be presented the above instructions if they sign in and are missing required information.
Open Unfinished profile setup - Mobile.svg
The user will be presented the above instructions if they are creating a new account.
Customer Matching
Guests that sign in create a user account. The user account is mapped to a customer in the point of sale (POS). It's vital to limit duplicate customer creation in the POS when possible. For that reason, Aspenware created a customer matching feature. When a guest creates a new user account, they will be prompted to complete their profile, which creates a customer record in the POS. When the provided information matches an existing customer in the POS, we send them through a matching process in order to prevent creation of a duplicate customer. Aspenware will endeavor to prevent a duplicate and will attempt to match with the following information (must match to all):
Email (
In RTP, this is an email profile)
First
Last
If the customer matched to only one (1) customer in the POS, Aspenware will send an email to the customer for them to verify that they are the owner of that email. Once verified, the customer will then be matched. The new Auth0 user account will be associated to the customer record found in the POS, and they can then sign in and purchase products on the resort commerce site.
If the customer matched to multiple customers in point of sale, the guest is presented with the resort’s phone number so they can call for help. At this point, Aspenware systems don’t know which customer to match to and will leave it up to the call center to make the determination with the customer.
Open image-20241009-150748.png
Single Match in RTP
Open image-20241009-150731.png
Multiple Match in RTP
The resort maintains responsibility over what to do when a guest matches to multiple customers. In order to address this issue, when the resort receives the call from the customer, one option is to merge those customers in the POS and then direct the guest to enter the credentials they previously created when attempting to create an account the first time. From there, the guest will receive the ‘account already exists’ message and be required to verify their email before logging in successfully.
Email Verification
Anytime verification is required (e.g. account linking or customer matching), the customer will receive an email with a code so they can verify as a second ‘factor.' The email will look something similar to the example below.
Open sample-email.png
SMTP
Email verifications will be sent from Auth0 using an SMTP provider.
Supported SMTP Providers: Sendgrid (Recommended), Mailgun, Mandrill, Amazon SES, Microsoft 365, Sparkpost, and Azure.
It is
strongly recommended
that the resort utilize an SMTP provider and have a dedicated IP address for transactional emails.
This will significantly increase the likelihood of guests receiving emails for any verification needs.
Merged Customers
Some point of sales, like RTP|One have the concept of merging customers. Whenever customers are merged in the point of sale (i.e. RTP|One), Aspenware’s platform will associate the user to the merged customer record. If two customers are merged in the point of sale that have different user accounts in Auth0 (i.e. a different authentication profile in RTP|One), the user is associated with the customer record containing their credentials.
Guest Checkout
Guest checkout is supported out of the box with Identity v3 (Powered by Auth0).  When a customer is purchasing a product that doesn’t require authentication, they will be presented with the option to log in if the email has been recognized as a previous account.  If selected, they will be routed to the Identity v3 (Powered by Auth0) login screen to authenticate.
Pass Media Account Lookup (Forgot Email)
Some guests may have forgotten which email they used to sign up. If this feature is enabled, resorts can allow guests to look up their email by inputting their pass number. Aspenware will configure Auth0 to enable this function so that once the user selects ‘Lookup email by pass number,' they will be directed to another page to input their pass number, as shown below.
Open image-20240501-163141.png
Select ‘lookup email by pass number’
Open image-20240501-163418.png

Creating an Account with a Pass
While account creation with a pass is supported in Identity v2, Identity v3 (Powered by Auth0) offers a more intuitive and streamlined experience. One of the key benefits of signing up with a pass is that guests can easily link new purchases to their existing pass.
How it Works:
Enter Pass Number
: Guests begin by entering their pass number. Aspenware will check if an account already exists for the guest.
Email Profile Verification
: If no existing account is found, Aspenware will then verify if there is an email associated with the guest's profile in RTP|One.
Email Invitation
: If an email is found, Aspenware will send a verification email inviting the guest to confirm their identity.
Account Creation
: The guest verifies their account by accepting the email invite, setting up a password, and completing their customer profile information. Once these steps are completed, the sign-up process is done!

Customer Found & Invite Sent
Open image-20240501-164449.png

If the guest already has an account, they will be redirected to sign-in if it’s been determined that an email exists in the auth profile in RTP|One for that pass.
Open image-20240513-191724.png
Account exists, sign in
If a guest enters a valid pass number, but the pass is not associated with an email, Aspenware will prevent the guest from signing up with that pass. This safeguard ensures that individuals who may have found or obtained someone else's pass cannot create an account with it.
In these cases, guests will be prompted to contact the resort for assistance in verifying and linking their pass to their account.
Open image-20240513-191821.png
No email to verify
Biomentrics Login
Biometrics are measurable, unique human traits—such as facial features or fingerprints—that applications can use to verify a person's identity. With biometric authentication, users can add an additional layer of security to their accounts, complementing traditional email and password logins. For more information, see
Biometrics Login
.
Bot Detection
Auth0 provides built-in bot detection and protection against unauthorized login attempts that can be enabled for partner resorts. When suspicious activity is detected, such as from certain IP addresses, Auth0 will prompt the user with a simple challenge, such as checking a box to confirm they are human.
Single Sign-On
Single Sign-On
Single Sign-On, or SSO is enabled with Aspenware. In the instance of a Resort Group with multiple resorts, a single guest can create credentials at one resort and use those same credentials across all related resorts, as long as the tenant is setup to do so.
Multi-Store SSO
Identity v3 will allow resort groups that utilize a shared Commerce instance to host multiple stores. This applies to various configurations:
Themes are applied per store
GTM IDs are applied per store
Logins are applied per store
Rewards
The Rewards module in RTP|One is integrated with Aspenware Identity v3 (Powered by Auth0). If a resort chooses to enable a rewards program, an enrollment checkbox will appear during the customer profile creation process. When selected, this will communicate directly with RTP|One and set the guest's enrollment status to "true" in the Rewards module.
Please note that the resort must configure their Rewards module in RTP|One before Aspenware can activate this feature in the sign-up flow.
Google Analytics
We have added Google Analytics tracking to Identity v3. For more information on the specific additions to the data layer, see
Identify v3 (Powered by Auth0) Configuration Guide
.
Monitoring & Alerting
Aspenware has implemented performance monitoring using Application Insights. Internal teams at Aspenware will receive alerts if any performance issues arise, such as multiple sign-in failures (e.g., 10 failures within 5 minutes). Aspenware regularly evaluates system performance to identify trends and works closely with Auth0 to continuously improve the platform, ensuring optimal performance for resort partners.
How will we alert the resort?
Aspenware will notify the resort if there are any significant performance issues affecting Identity v3.
During office hours
Customer Success Representative to notify resort after being notified via Slack.
After office hours
On-call Representative will notify resort after being notified via Slack.
3rd Party Applications
All existing (and new) 3rd party applications from Identity v2 are may be added to Identity v3. See the
Identify v3 (Powered by Auth0) Configuration Guide
for details about setup of this feature.
Aspenware will provide documentation and consultation if/when resorts wish to migrate their applications to using Identity v3 (Powered by
Auth0)
. Please
contact
your Aspenware Service Agent for more information.
Theming
Aspenware will theme the resort Auth0 pages based on the criteria submitted via Theme Designer. If the resort is a current Aspenware customer, most of the information can be utilized from Identity v2, but some new information will be required.
Theming the Auth0 pages will be part of the resort implementation process. All requests will go through the Aspenware Team and they will be responsible for setting up the initial theme on the resort Identity v3 pages once the tenant is setup.

functions
are not supported with Identity v3 (Powered by Auth0):

Q: Does IDv3 work for multi-store?
Q: If someone calls to troubleshoot their account, how can my support staff still help?
A: Credentials will still be stored in RTP and you will be able to change their password or username/email as you always have done in the past. Once credentials are migrated out of RTP, AW will setup a tool to allow the Resort team to reset passwords and view username/emails.
Q: What happens if the password strength I setup in Auth0 is ‘stronger’ than what I originally setup in Identity?
A: Nothing adverse will happen to the guest. Auth0 will not validate if the password meets the new requirements if those credentials were in place prior to the transition to Auth0.
Q: What if I use Inntopia to send emails?
A: Inntopia is not supported in Auth0 as an SMTP provider. It is strongly recommended that you utilize Sendgrid to send Auth0 emails or any other supported SMTP provider (noted above in this documentation).
Q: What happens once I turn Auth0 on?
A: The existing Identity pages will still be present but the guests will be routed to the new Auth0 login URL (which can be the same as the identity page). If credentials are still being stored in RTP, the auth profile in RTP will continue to be populated with email and password for the guest.
Q: Can I customize my theme?
A: Yes. There are limits to what can be branded as noted in the theming section.
Q: Can I customize my emails?
A: Yes. We can leverage the templates in Auth0 to customize email content, but cannot use HTML.
Q: Can I customize the error messages?
A: Yes. We are allowing minimal customizations to occur on various error messages as they can be tied to specific metrics we are tracking based on the content.
Q: What happens if I need to revert back to IDv2?
A: Ideally, we will endeavor to fix any issues in IDv3 but do have the ability to roll-back to IDv2 in extreme circumstances.
Q: Does IDv3 work for multi-store?
A: Yes. All IDv3 configurations are on a per store basis. There are limited theming options per store on the login pages and any Google Analytics events can be tied per store.

OpenAPI Specs
Overview
This feature enables a resort to connect users from their customer data platform (CDP) to accounts in Aspenware’s Identity v3. This connection can be used to associate customer records in a resort system with the associated customer in Aspenware during login or sign-up. It allows custom resort apps to leverage Aspenware authentication more seamlessly.
Prerequisites
A resort must be on Identity v3 and create a Custom Claim API endpoint as per the instructions below, in order to use this integration.
How does it work?
This feature is built on an integration method called a Custom Claim hook, which is a payload of information that is added to a secure access token.
During the login or sign-up process, Identity v3 will make a server-side
POST
request to a hook endpoint provided by the resort. Aspenware will send user profile data including an RTP IPCode. In response, the hook can return plain text (structured or otherwise) that will be placed in a custom claim called
customIntegration
. This value can then be read by any
relying parties
.
Example
A practical example of this integration is within a resort’s native mobile app. The resort does not have its own accounts/login system, but wants to leverage the same login that’s present on its Aspenware store. The resort’s mobile app will also integrate with a proprietary loyalty system, as well as the resort’s lodging platform.
In order to reduce latency and simplify customer lookup requests, the resort can create a Custom Claims endpoint that integrates with this feature.
Behind this endpoint, the resort queries its CDP to find a lodging user id and the loyalty system user id associated with the person logging in. These third-party identifiers get embedded in Aspenware’s Identity v3 access token. Post-login, the native mobile app can trust these identifiers and use them to deliver a personalized experience.
API Endpoint Requirements
The integrating service’s API endpoint must meet the following requirements:
Maximum response latency: 500 milliseconds
Content type: Anything that can be parsed as
plain text
Maximum content size: 1KB
If the response does not meet any of these requirements,
no claim
will be created and the user
will continue
through the login process (failing open). If the endpoint does not return a
200
status code, it will be treated as an error and no claim will be created.
Additional details about the hook, including the request body schema are in the OpenAPI specs section below.
Use of PII Data
The use case for sharing the guests’ PII (first name, last name, email, phone, zip) is focused on the following scenario:
A new user creates an account on Aspenware and the resort CDP doesn’t have any information about this user yet. Aspenware includes PII in the call so that the external system has something with which it can construct a profile immediately, without an additional query back to the source of truth (RTP).
When existing users log in, if the external system has a matching customer with the Aspenware provided
posCustomerId
, then the PII data should be retrieved from the source of truth, which is the POS.
This is important to note in the integration logic because Aspenware data should not be considered the source of truth and will not be 100% up to date if changes are made to first name, last name, phone or zip in the POS. The email address will be kept up to date however, as that is used for login.
If an account merge occurs in the POS, the RTP IPcode of an Aspenware user will be updated at the next login
.
Configurations
Please work with your
Aspenware Customer Success
in order to implement this feature. On a per-Identity v3
environment
basis, we will need to know the
following
:
Configuration Name
Description
Examples
Configuration Name
Description
Examples
Custom claim endpoint URL
The URL that Identity v3 will send the API request to.
https://example.com/api/get-user-claims
Authorization header name
The header name that the auth value will be put in to authenticate the request. This will typically be
Authorization
.
Authorization
,
X-API-KEY
Authorization header value
The constant value that will be placed in the header to authenticate the request.
My API Key
,
Bearer abc123=
Multi-Store Configurations
There is no extra support for multi-store configurations. All hook configuration values are shared across the Identity v3 tenant.
Authentication
Currently, the only supported authentication type is akin to an API key. You can specify a name and value that Identity v3 will include in the header of its requests.

Resort Tools reduces time spent waiting in line for guests and time spent by resort staff checking guests in across your resort.
Overview
Resort Tools encompasses two products that can be used in one of two ways or in tandem for the optimal onsite guest experience. The two offerings are as follows:
Resort Tools - Kiosk
Resort Tools - Kiosk
is designed for guests to complete the required information at a resort kiosk Our user-facing kiosk is designed to capture required information in your rental stores, pass offices and lesson locations. The streamlined user flow is designed for ease of use and accurate customer profiles. Resorts mitigate risk with the careful completion and collection of required documents.
All guests at a particular location will be guided through the same process, which is optimized for that location. The product can operate without an internet connection if configured for offline use. Guests can use a fast-flow option with pre-filled information, but personalization based on guest data and order details is unavailable. If personalization is important,
Aspenware Arrival
may be a better option. To use Resort Tools - Kiosk, a Resort Tools or Aspenware Arrival license is required.

Ongoing Support and Maintenance
This solution supports the use of the SKIDATA Skiosk to print media from an RTP order or sales transaction.  Sales that contain deferred printable media from RTP are uploaded to SKIDATA’s SWEB tool which can then be printed on the Skiosk.  Once printed, SKIDATA sends the RFID back to RTP and marks the media as printed.  The media can then be used for validation in RTP.
Solution Overview
There are 4 main aspects to this solution.  1) SKIDATA DTA/SWEB, 2) Unity Contractor Service, 3) Unity DTA Jobs, and 4) RTP.
Open image-20230425-162904.png
SKIDATA DTA/SWEB
SKIDATA provides access to SWEB during the implementation and will also provide training on the tool.  Typically SWEB is accessed often during the initial implementation phase to verify interfaced products and orders but then less after go-live.  The interface between Aspenware and SKIDATA only uses a small portion of SWEB which is also used with SKIDATAs POS and parking system.
SKIDTA Skiosks
This is the hardware that prints RFID cards (shown above).
DTA
This is the name of the interface used by a 3rd party system to interact with SKIDATA’s system.
SWEB
SWEB is the name of the user interface used by the SKIDATA Skiosks and can be used to view interfaced products and orders.  The printing template the Skiosks use is also defined in SWEB.
Open image-20230425-181722.png
Unity Contactor Service
The Unity Contractor Service is an Aspenware-created Windows IIS application that is installed locally at the resort. The application is used for for 2 purposes which are to create products in SKIDATA’s SWEB application (via the catalog import function) and to upload the RFID from the Skiosk back into RTP and to mark the media as printed.
An RTP Client Code is defined in the SKIDATA SWEB tool which is used in the catalog import process to lookup products in RTP that are eligible to be printed on the Skoisk.  A product is created in SWEB for each RTP product and a mapping is automatically defined to the RTP product header code.  Only products that are interfaced to SWEB through the catalog import process are then eligible to printed on the Skiosks.  Once printed, SWEB sends the RFID back to the Unity Contractor Service where it is uploaded into RTP’s ExternalAccessMap table and the media is marked as printed in the TransactionProductOutput table.
Unity DTA Jobs
The Unity DTA Jobs service is also an Aspenware-created Windows IIS application that is installed locally at the resort.  This application polls RTP’s TransactionProductOutput table every minute for new records.  Only transactions with products that have previously been interfaced to SKIDATA’s SWEB tool (via the catalog import) will be picked up by the service and sent to SKIDATA to create an order.  An Order is created in SWEB with a reference to the RTP Sales Transaction ID, Order ID or External Order ID which is used to retrieve the order and print (usually from a QR or barcode).
RTP
RTP sales transactions and fulfilled orders that contain deferred media of season pass and access products are eligible to be printed on the Skiosks.  As mentioned previously, the products must first be included in the catalog import process and interfaced to SWEB before a sales transaction or fulfilled order containing deferred media will be created in SWEB as an Order.
RTP Client Code
The RTP Client Code defined in SWEB will be used by the catalog import to lookup which products meet the criteria to be included in the import process.
Products must be priced in RTP for the day the catalog import runs.
An existing RTP Client Code can be used or a new one can be created.  The Sale Location assigned to the Client in RTP can also be an existing sale location or a new one dedicated to a new Skiosk Location.  The benefit of using a new sale location is that products could be priced for all dates.  If products are only priced for part of the year, it is likely multiple catalog imports will need to be performed in order to interface those products to SWEB making transactions and orders that contain these products eligible to be printed on the Skiosks.  If products are available all season, then it is possible only a single catalog import will need to be run at the beginning of the season.
The Client Code will also be uploaded into several RTP tables as the client code that printed the media (i.e. TransactionProductOutput.OutputClientCode).
Detailed Setup Guide
The following instructions detail the setup steps for using the SKIDATA Skiosk to print media from an RTP order or sales transaction.
Set Up SWEB Contractor
Import SWEB Catalog
Configure SWEB Print Mask (Media Template)
Install Aspenware IIS Application
Test UnityDTAJobs Install

1. Set Up SWEB Contractor
The Unity Contractor Service URL is define in SWEB which is where SKIDATA will configure a Contractor entry. Aspenware will provide the URL to the Unity Contractor Service once it is setup or will add the URL to SWEB.  This can be found in SWEB in Sales Management / Tenants / Contractors.
Following is an example from Aspenware’s test environment.
Edit the Contractor entry and then navigate to the Contractor System tab to define the URL.

2. Click ‘Check Connectivity’ to test the connection from SKIDATA’s SWEB tool to the Unity Contractor Service installed locally at the resort.  The URL format is below but will differ for each install =
https://servername.com/UnityContractorService/ContractorService.svc
Open image-20230425-203735.png
Open image-20230502-153641.png
2. Import SWEB Catalog
SKIDATA will configure portions of SWEB prior to the first catalog import.  The catalog import can be found in SWEB in Sales Management > Configuration > Catalogs and there is typically only one entry created for the resort.  The RTP Client Code that will be used to lookup products in RTP is defined in the External ID field (see below).  At least one catalog import will need to be completed prior to any attempt to print from the Skiosks.
Open image-20230425-202054.png
To start the catalog import, click the
Import
button along the top ribbon. Then click
Start Import
.
Open image-20230425-202607.png
2. The import process only takes a few seconds.  To view the products imported, click the Products button along the top ribbon.
Open image-20230425-202713.png
3. If the import was successful, products will show in the list.  Use the gear/settings icon to show the External Id column which shows the RTP Product Header code.
Open image-20230425-202911.png
3. Configure SWEB Print Mask (Media Template)
The catalog import also configures a Print Mask in SWEB which is the media template that prints when a Skiosk order is fulfilled.  This is located in Sales Management > Configuration > Print Masks.  Each time the catalog imports runs, the print mask gets set back to the default which some customers do not use.
It is recommended to define the Print Mask during testing and then to export the template from SWEB and then re-import after each catalog import.
The default template pulls a description from one of the Unity Contractor Service configuration files so this could be used to define a short text line on the template (e.g., Winter 22-23).  Some customers use this and therefore need to remember to update the configuration file after each season.  Each time the configuration file is updated, a catalog import will need to be performed to add the new descriptions to SWEB.  The text is located in the web.config file in the DTA ticketText field.  Additional information can be found on this in the install section of this guide.

4. Install Aspenware IIS Application
Aspenware will perform 2 installations on Unity in conjunction with this implementation.
Install Unity Contractor Service
Aspenware will install the Unity Contractor Service on a server at the resort that is accessible to the SKIDATA web services.  SKIDATA will provide the IP range of the traffic so that the server can be locked down.  The Unity Contractor Service is an IIS application that is accessed by SKIDATA for the catalog import function and to upload printed RFID’s to RTP.
The following config/json files contain all the configuration values needed for the service.
Rtp-config.json
– contains all RTP configuration values
SalesChannelCode:
Sales channel used for the product catalog import.  Products need to be priced for the day the catalog imports runs and to have output added in RTP for the sales channel defined.
UserID
: This must be a valid user with a valid UserSession.SessionToken in RTP.  This user will be the OperatorID that printed the media in several RTP database tables.
Database Connection string (server, db, SQL user)
: Aspenware will create a new SQL Role and User and the Role needs to have privileges to the following tables.  Aspenware can configure this in SSMS or provide a script.
GRANT SELECT ON  [dbo].[TransactionProductOutput] TO [awdtarole]
GRANT UPDATE ON  [dbo].[TransactionProductOutput] TO [awdtarole]
GRANT SELECT ON  [dbo].[TransactionLineOriginalTransactionLine] TO [awdtarole]

ClientCode
: Client code used for product catalog import.
SaleLocationCode
: Sale location used for the product catalog import.
AuditLocationCod
e: Not used but set to the same location code above.
Web.config
– contains additional setup data
Skiosks:
Defines mapping for SKIDATA Skiosk and RTP Client code.  This client code will be updated in RTP’s TransactionProductOutput.OutputClientCode column as the client that printed the output and shows in various places in RTP.  Currently on a single mapping is supported by SKIDATA.  Define the SKIDATA Sales Channel name to map to the RTP client code in this section.
Open image-20230502-153258.png
ticketText:
Text data is imported during catalog import to SWEB/Print Mask, ‘Text Print Mask Item 1’. If text is changed directly in SWEB, data will be overwritten with text defined in web.config in next catalog import.  If this media element is not added to the Print Mask in SWEB, there is no need to update this from season to season.
priceCategoryName:
Text data is imported during catalog import to SWEB/Price Category.  This description does not show during fulfillment but does show in SKIDATA admin.  Typically this description is set to match the same description of ticketText above.
seasonStartDate
&
seasonEndDate:
Dates are imported during catalog import to SWEB/Time Periods.  Aspenware recommends defining a large data range to avoid having to update each season since this data only shows in SKIDATA admin.

Test the Unity Contractor Service install by entering the URL into a browser to verify a service page displays instead of an error page.
Example of URL:
https://aspenware.com/UnityContractorService/ContractorService.svc
Install Unity DTA Jobs
Aspenware will install the Unity DTA Jobs on a server at the resort that is accessible to the SKIDATA DTA web services.  SKIDATA will provide the IP range of the traffic so that the server can be locked down.  The Unity DTA Jobs is an IIS application that is used to look up transactions in RTP that have deferred output and to create orders in SKIDATA’s SWEB application.  Microsoft’s dotnet-hosting will also need to be installed on the server hosting the UnityDTAJobs application.
The UnityDTA Jobs service uses Hangfire which is a 3rd party product used to perform background processing in .NET and .NET Core applications.  Hangfire has several database tables that will also need to be deployed which are described below.
Install UnityDTAJobs database
Aspenware has scripts to install the UnityDTAJobs database which also include database tables for Hangfire.  These tables track which RTP transactions have been sent to SKIDATA/SWEB.  See below for screenshot of the tables included in the UnityDTAJobs database.
Open image-20230509-145344.png
Configure UnityDTAJobs
The following config/json files contain all the configuration values needed for the UnityDTAJobs service.
appsettings.json

5. Test UnityDTAJobs Install
Once installed, navigate to
http://localhost/UnityDTAJobs/hangfire/
in a browser on the machine hosting the application.  If the install was successful, the Hangfire Dashboard should show rather than an error page.  The Realtime Graph below shows the number of transactions processed and the History Graph shows the total uptime of the Hangfire service.
Open image-20230502-183550.png
6. Trigger Sending RTP Transactions to SKIDATA/SWEB
The UnityDTAJobs IIS application uses the dta.LastProcessedTransaction table to track the transactions that have already been sent to SKIDATA.  During the implementation, the ProcessDate will be set to a date in the past and will begin processing once the IIS application is started.  Once the date catches up to the current date, only new transactions containing deferred output will be processed moving forward.
Open image-20230502-184200.png
Every RTP transaction is reviewed by the service to see if there is any deferred output that meets the criteria to be sent to SKIDATA to create an order.  The criteria is that the product in the transaction has been previously interfaced to SKIDATA using the product catalog import and that the product has the Rule, ‘Skidata Print PUB’ added (See rules information below).  Each RTP transaction ID that meets the criteria, will be created in SWEB as an Order and the DTAOrderID will be recorded in the dta.Reservation table.
Open image-20230502-184402.png
The DTAOrderID will also be updated into RTP’s TransactionHeader table in the OfflineTransactionID field.
Open image-20230509-150511.png
Below shows an Order in SWEB created from RTP Transaction ID, 101525809.  If the order originated from an Aspenware online order, the ConfirmationNumber will be the RTP ExternalOrderID (i.e. PK12345).
Open image-20230502-184727.png
7. Select Testing Method
It is possible to point all the services to RTPOneTest to perform testing but it is easier to test against RTPOne prod instead.  The main issue with using RTPOneTest is that SKIDATA does not have a test system so it’s possible that an RTP TransactionID that was interfaced to SKIDATA/SWEB during testing from RTPOneTest will exist in RTPOne production as a real customer’s TransactionID.  The SKIDATA development team can clear out orders that were created during testing but using the method below against RTPOne prod is preferred for testing.
Below is an outline to perform initial testing without interfacing all RTP transactions to SKIDATA SWEB.
Set the dta.LastProcessedTransaction table to have a ProcessDate of today for all rows.
Recycle the UnityDTAJobs application pool (or start the service).
Create or clone an RTP Product Header that contains media output that has never been sold to a customer and add all three Skiosk related Rules (Unity Attribute - Age, Unity Attribute - Duration, and SkiData Print on PUB).
In SKIDATA SWEB, start the product catalog import and verify the new product shows up
If no product, review the SWEB DTA Transaction Logs for any errors.
If no errors in DTA Transaction Logs, review the UnityContractorService log
If no errors in the UnityContractorService log, start SQL trace to see call hitting RTP and manually run in SSMS.  This may reveal that the product does not meet the criteria to be interfaced (pricing, sales channel, sale location, etc).
In RTP, create a sales transaction and sell the product created in step 1 above.  Make sure to defer media during the sale.
In SWEB, make sure you see an Order show up within a minute or two.
If no order in SWEB, verify the UnityDTAJobs IIS application is running (verify the application pool is started).
If UnityDTAJobs is running, check error log.
If no errors, verify there is deferred output in RTP’s Deferred Output Tool.
Check the UnityDTAJobs table, dta.Reservation for the most recent entries to see if there are errors.
Create a barcode or QR code of the RTP TransactionID and attempt to use at Skiosk.
If nothing prints, re-verify the Transactions is in SWEB as an Order
If Order exists but nothing prints, ask SKIDATA to check the Skiosk log (which is located directly on the PC inside the Skiosk hardware.
If media prints, verify the RFID can be used to perform a search in RTP.
If RFID cannot be searched successfully in RTP, look for errors in the UnityContractorService log.
Repeat steps above for an RTP OrderID that is manually created and fulfilled in RTP and for an online order.
For an Order created directly in RTP, use the RTP OrderID as the barcode/QR code at the Skiosk.
For an online order, use the RTP ExternalOrderID as the barcode/QR code at the Skiosk.
8. Add Rules to Product Header Code(s)
Three Product Header Rules need to be added to any product that will be printed from the Skiosk.
IMPORTANT
:
DO NOT ADD THESE RULES UNTIL GO-LIVE.
More info on this can be found in the testing section of this document below.
Rule 1: Unity Attribute - Duration
Add Duration rule to Product Header Codes per the diagram and define a value of 1.
Open image-20230613-212505.png
Duration Rule
Rule 2: Unity Attribute - Age
Add Age rule to Product Header Codes per the diagram and define a value of 1.
Open image-20230613-212816.png
Age Rule
Rule 3: SkiData Print on PUB
Add SkiData Print on PUB Rule to Product Header Codes and define a value of TRUE.
Open image-20230613-213139.png
SKIDATA Print on PUB Rule
Open image-20230425-182209.png
Example of Rules added to PHC
Configure Product components to have Output and to Allow Deferral.
NOTE
: If after go-live, the resort realizes they did not add the three Rules to all products, the catalog import can be run again and the ProcessDate in the dta.LastProcessedTransaction can be set back to a date in the past.  The service will run and skip over any transaction it has already processed and only create orders in SWEB for transactions containing the new products.  This process will also take a few hours because every transaction is reviewed again by the service.
9. Go Live
Going live with the Skiosks means ensuring all products in RTP have the three rules added and then setting the ProcessDate in the dta.LastProcessedTransaction to a date in the past.  If the testing method above was followed, there should be no need to clear out data in the dta.Reservation table.
Stop the UnityDTAJobs application pool.
Ensure the 3 product header rules have been added to all products.
(SEE SECTION ABOVE)
Start the product catalog import in SWEB
Ask the resort to review the list of products.  If products are missing, ask the resort to add the three Rules to additional products and/or verify the product(s) are priced for ‘today'.
Repeat this step until the resort verifies all products are showing in SWEB.
Set the dta.LastProcessedTransaction table to have a ProcessDate in the past.  This should be the date of or right before the date they started selling media products for the season.
Start the UnityDTAJobs application pool.
Verify Orders are showing in SKIDATA SWEB.  This process can take a few hours depending on how far back the date goes and how many total transaction's the resort has.
To verify the initial load of Orders is complete, verify the ProcessDate for the Reservation column now shows today’s date.
Orders Creation in SWEB from RTP Sales Transactions
The Unity DTA Service is always running in the customer’s environment and is looking for new RTP transactions that contain deferred pass media and access output.  The products in these transactions need to have the Product Header Rule, SkiData Print On PUB and the products must currently be in SWEB from a catalog import.  If all these conditions are met, an Order gets created in SWEB which can be viewed in Sales Management > Monitoring > Orders (see below).  Once the Order is created in SWEB, it can then be printed from the Skiosk.
If an order or is cancelled in RTP or the fulfillment transactions has been returned, the order is then cancelled in SKIDATA/SWEB and cannot be printed.
The ‘Confirmation Number’ that appears in SWEB will be the RTP Sales Transaction ID if the deferred output is associated with an RTP sales transaction (completed directly in RTP), an RTP OrderID if the deferred output originated from an RTP order (completed directly in  RTP), or the ExternalOrderID if the sale originated from an Aspenware order (or any 3rd party processing orders into RTP).
This is the only value mapped to the SKIDATA Order and is the only value that can be used to find and print the order on the Skiosk.
In other words, for an Aspenware order, only the ExternalOrderID will get mapped to the Order in SWEB so only that value can be used to find the order and print the media from the Skiosk.  The RTP OrderID from Aspenware’s order cannot be used to find the order in SWEB.
Open image-20230425-223635.png
Ongoing Support and Maintenance
Depending on the products being printed on the Skiosks, additional product catalog imports may need to be run in the future.  Some resorts have very few products that haven’t changed from year to year so they may have only used the catalog import function during the initial implementation.  Resorts that are not bundling media with access on product headers may have very few media product headers and therefore very few interfaced products in SKIDATA/SWEB.  Resorts that bundle media and access may have dozens or hundreds of products interfaced to SKIDATA/SWEB.
The key thing to remember is that ‘todays’ date is used when the catalog import runs so if a resort does not have pricing setup until their opening date (i.e. 11/15/2024), then running the catalog import in October will not interface products to SKIDATA/SWEB.
As mentioned above, each time the catalog import is run in SWEB, the Print Mask resets back to the default so if the resort isn’t using the default, they will need to import the Print Mask file after each import.

The Aspenware Scanning application integrates into RTP’s access control system and can be used to process online and offline scans.  The application runs on handheld devices running Android kitkat up to version 11 of Android  (version 4.4 to version 11) which also have the DataWedge application (typically Zebra devices).  The devices connect via http or https to a server within the resorts internal local area network (LAN) running Aspenware’s Unity API.  Unity then communicates to the RTP database on the resorts LAN to verify scanning data and retrieve customer information.  The Unity API can be installed on the existing RTP application server or on another server located within the resort’s LAN.
The devices should be configured on the resorts local area network (LAN) and not a through a public wireless access point.  The devices should not have access to the internet, and it is the resorts responsibility to secure access to the scanner data and network traffic.  It is also recommended to disable Bluetooth and any cellular networks on the device.
There are 3 main aspects of this solution, 1) Android Device (AWScanning.apk), 2) Unity, and 3) RTP
Open image-20210512-191746.png
Settings Overview
The Aspenware Scanning application settings allow configuring the device behavior on the Login page and when scanning barcodes and reading RFID media cards.  The Login page can be configured to require scanning barcodes/RFID cards in order to sign-in as well as to require the user of a valid RTP UserID.  To gain access to the device settings, manually enter or scan a barcode of the word, ‘SETTINGS’.  This will automatically display the settings page on the device.

Web Service
– defines connectivity information for the device to connect to Unity.
Device
– defines DeviceID as well as behavior of the Login page.  See below for more info on each setting.
Sound Settings
– defines sound and vibration settings for offline, validate only and live  scans.  See below for more info on sound settings.
UHF Scan Settings
– only displays on a device that is configured to use UHF.  These settings control the default trigger mode, range of the UHF reader and RFID conversion type.  See below for more info on each setting.

Device ID
– defines the ID used to record scans in RTP.  Recommend defining a unique Device ID per device.
Require Location Scan
– determines whether user can manually select Access Location or if scanning a barcode is required to sign-in.  If set to Y, user must scan a valid AccessLocationCode from RTP (i.e barcode of 100, 110, 120, etc.)
Validate UserID
– determines whether username is a validated against RTP.  If enabled, a valid RTP UserID must be used to sign-in.
Force Login Scan
– determines whether a user must scan a pass media barcode or read an RFID card to sign-in.  If enabled, the RTP IPCode the pass belongs to must be added to a UserID in Admin/Security Administration/User in RTP:
Open image-20210512-192321.png
Enable Add Customer ID
–enables functionality to allow operator to enter an RTP Customer ID (IPCode) when a certain RTP Access Error is returned as a scan result.  After entering customer ID, a new scan will be triggered that appends the {CustomerID} to the end of the previously scanned code.
Customer ID Scan Code –
click to enter a specific RTP Access Error ‘Error Message’ for the Enable Add Customer ID functionality.  This will be the only RTP Access Error that will trigger this functionality to allow an operator to enter a Customer ID (IPCode).  For example, ‘Bad Type’ is entered below so when this scan result is returned to the scanner, the ‘Add Customer ID’ option will display allowing the operator to enter an RTP IPCode.
Open image-20210512-192356.png
After scan occurs that returns this type, the Add Customer ID button appears:
Open image-20210512-192410.png
Which allows the operator to enter data which then gets appended to the previously scanned code and triggers a new scan:

Settings - Sound Settings
Sound settings define the sound generated for an Offline, Validate Only and Live Scan on the device.  Several sounds are delivered in each category and custom sounds can also be uploaded as of v1.14 of the app.  You can also define whether the device vibrates with each type of sound by checking the Vibrate checkbox.
For Live Scans, ‘Beep’ settings are used to map to valid and invalid scans from RTP Access Rule Product Type administration.  Settings for 1 and 3 Beeps are delivered with the device and map to a valid and invalid scan from RTP (3 is always an invalid scan in RTP).  Additional Beeps can be added which map to RTP’s Access Rule Product Type administration entries.  To add new Beeps, click the ‘New Setting’ button below and define an un-used Beep Count, Sound and Vibrate setting.  ‘4 Beeps’ has been added in the screen shot below.  After adding a new setting, you must click the ‘Save Settings’ button.
Open image-20210512-192832.png
To upload custom sounds
, place a .wav file in the devices Notification directory and select the custom sound file when defining new beeps or when editing the Offline and/or Validate Only settings.  For example, in the screen shots below, the ‘LightningSound.wav’ was uploaded to the device making it available to select through the app.

– impacts the range of the scanner.  When enabled, the max range of the device will be used to scan RFID tags.  The max range for the Zebra MC3300 is 270 but this can differ per device.  This value is a numeric value that relates to a dBm value (decibels with reference to one milliwatt.)  The Zebra MC3300 has a range of 0-30 dBm so a value of 270 is equivalent to 30 dBM.
Transmit Power
– used when Use Max Transmit Power is disabled and defines transmit power other than the max value.  It is likely that this setting will need to be adjusted for each customer to find the optimal setting.  A lower value (i.e. 30 or 50) makes it easier to scan a specific tag while a higher value allows reading tags from greater distances.
Set Tag Population
– enabled or disabled.
Tag Population
– if Set Tag Population is enabled, this value defines the estimated number of tags that will be in range of the scanner.
Convert IDs to Base 32
– enabled or disabled
If enabled, Id is converted to Base 32 (i.e. 1OG000B706016C1N1R02)
If disabled, Id is Base 16 (i.e. E28068900000000163F009B9)
Use TID Memory Bank
– enables the application to use the value stored in the TID memory bank instead of the default tagId.  Typically ‘Convert IDs to Base 32’ is also selected when this is enabled.
Use EPC Memory Bank
– enables the application to use the value stored in the EPC memory bank instead of the default tagId.  Typically ‘Convert IDs to Base 32’ is also selected when this is enabled.
Login Page
Based on how Login Settings are defined, the login page will appear with various options.
Login page requiring Login Scan but not a Location Scan. User must manually define the Access Location Group and Access Location:

Identity v3 (Powered by Auth0) is Aspenware’s next-generation identity management product.
This feature is supported for
Aspenware Cloud customers.
This feature is not supported
for resorts using Siriusware.
Key Terms
Actions
Secure, tenant-specific, versioned functions written in Node.js that execute at certain points during the Auth0 runtime. Actions are used to customize and extend Auth0's capabilities with custom logic.
Applications
Software that relies on Auth0 for authentication and identity management. Auth0 supports single-page, regular web, native, and machine-to-machine applications.
Biometrics
Authentication process that allows the user to leverage FaceID or Fingerprint scanning.
Connection
Relationship between Auth0 and the sources of users for your applications. Examples include identity providers (such as Google or Active Directory), passwordless authentication methods, or user databases.
Custom Domain
Third-party domain with a specialized, or vanity, name. Also known as a CNAME.
Organizations
Auth0 product that allows B2B customers to categorize end-users and define specific roles, login experience, and access to resources.
Tenants
A logically-isolated group of users who share common access with specific privileges to a single software instance.
Identity v3 (Powered by Auth0)
Aspenware Identity v3 (Powered by Auth0) marks a significant leap forward in secure, reliable, and modern identity features for our valued customers. In addition to the basic login & sign-up features, this product includes customer matching logic that will help reduce duplicate customers and account for any merging of customers in RTP.
As part of Aspenware’s ongoing commitment to safety and efficiency when rolling out new products and features, we will closely monitor and evaluate data in Auth0 and in Google Analytics. This ensures smooth operations and a seamless experience for all stakeholders.
What is Auth0?
Auth0
is an identity access management (IAM) provider. An IAM solution is a gatekeeper to the resources you provide to customers as web applications, APIs, etc, adding layers of authentication to secure your users’ digital identities and your product. The Auth0 identity platform supports regular web, mobile, or machine-to-machine apps.
The Identity v3 (Powered by Auth0) platform allows Aspenware to customize login services to fit your business, technology, and customer base.
Why Auth0?
Best in-class identity access management platform
Secure platform
Ability to easily extend into
SSO, social, biometrics, MFA, and passwordless which has been proven to increase conversion rates
Quick onboarding experience for customers.
Product Features
Sign in & Create Account
Your guests can utilize a standard login & create account flow using an email and password. The guest will be required to remember these credentials every season unless they decide to switch to other methods such as passwordless, which will be available in an upcoming release.
For any existing customer in RTP that signs in and has any missing information that is required upon sign up, the guest will be prompted with ‘complete your profile’ and be asked to input any missing data.  For example, if a customer/user exists in RTP with all fields except phone number, the guest will be shown
only
phone number field and be required to complete prior to signing in.
Note.
If a new guest signs up and doesn’t complete their profile here, RTP will be populated with a first and last name of the guests email address.  Due to RTP requirements and how auth0 works in conjunction, we must populate those fields so we can associated the auth0 account with an RTP customer ID.  Once the user completes the process of signing up, those fields will be replaced by their values they enter for first and last name.
Open image-20241009-150444.png
Create User Account
Open Missing info complete profile - Mobile.svg
The user will be presented the above instructions if they sign in and are missing required information.
Open Unfinished profile setup - Mobile.svg
The user will be presented the above instructions if they are creating a new account.
Customer Matching
Guests that sign in create a user account. The user account is mapped to a customer in the point of sale (POS). It's vital to limit duplicate customer creation in the POS when possible. For that reason, Aspenware created a customer matching feature. When a guest creates a new user account, they will be prompted to complete their profile, which creates a customer record in the POS. When the provided information matches an existing customer in the POS, we send them through a matching process in order to prevent creation of a duplicate customer. Aspenware will endeavor to prevent a duplicate and will attempt to match with the following information (must match to all):
Email (
In RTP, this is an email profile)
First
Last
If the customer matched to only one (1) customer in the POS, Aspenware will send an email to the customer for them to verify that they are the owner of that email. Once verified, the customer will then be matched. The new Auth0 user account will be associated to the customer record found in the POS, and they can then sign in and purchase products on the resort commerce site.
If the customer matched to multiple customers in point of sale, the guest is presented with the resort’s phone number so they can call for help. At this point, Aspenware systems don’t know which customer to match to and will leave it up to the call center to make the determination with the customer.
Open image-20241009-150748.png
Single Match in RTP
Open image-20241009-150731.png
Multiple Match in RTP
The resort maintains responsibility over what to do when a guest matches to multiple customers. In order to address this issue, when the resort receives the call from the customer, one option is to merge those customers in the POS and then direct the guest to enter the credentials they previously created when attempting to create an account the first time. From there, the guest will receive the ‘account already exists’ message and be required to verify their email before logging in successfully.
Email Verification
Anytime verification is required (e.g. account linking or customer matching), the customer will receive an email with a code so they can verify as a second ‘factor.' The email will look something similar to the example below.
Open sample-email.png
SMTP
Email verifications will be sent from Auth0 using an SMTP provider.
Supported SMTP Providers: Sendgrid (Recommended), Mailgun, Mandrill, Amazon SES, Microsoft 365, Sparkpost, and Azure.
It is
strongly recommended
that the resort utilize an SMTP provider and have a dedicated IP address for transactional emails.
This will significantly increase the likelihood of guests receiving emails for any verification needs.
Merged Customers
Some point of sales, like RTP|One have the concept of merging customers. Whenever customers are merged in the point of sale (i.e. RTP|One), Aspenware’s platform will associate the user to the merged customer record. If two customers are merged in the point of sale that have different user accounts in Auth0 (i.e. a different authentication profile in RTP|One), the user is associated with the customer record containing their credentials.
Guest Checkout
Guest checkout is supported out of the box with Identity v3 (Powered by Auth0).  When a customer is purchasing a product that doesn’t require authentication, they will be presented with the option to log in if the email has been recognized as a previous account.  If selected, they will be routed to the Identity v3 (Powered by Auth0) login screen to authenticate.
Pass Media Account Lookup (Forgot Email)
Some guests may have forgotten which email they used to sign up. If this feature is enabled, resorts can allow guests to look up their email by inputting their pass number. Aspenware will configure Auth0 to enable this function so that once the user selects ‘Lookup email by pass number,' they will be directed to another page to input their pass number, as shown below.
Open image-20240501-163141.png
Select ‘lookup email by pass number’
Open image-20240501-163418.png
Enter pass number
Open image-20240501-163446.png
Account found
Creating an Account with a Pass
While account creation with a pass is supported in Identity v2, Identity v3 (Powered by Auth0) offers a more intuitive and streamlined experience. One of the key benefits of signing up with a pass is that guests can easily link new purchases to their existing pass.
How it Works:
Enter Pass Number
: Guests begin by entering their pass number. Aspenware will check if an account already exists for the guest.
Email Profile Verification
: If no existing account is found, Aspenware will then verify if there is an email associated with the guest's profile in RTP|One.
Email Invitation
: If an email is found, Aspenware will send a verification email inviting the guest to confirm their identity.
Account Creation
: The guest verifies their account by accepting the email invite, setting up a password, and completing their customer profile information. Once these steps are completed, the sign-up process is done!

Customer Found & Invite Sent
Open image-20240501-164449.png

If the guest already has an account, they will be redirected to sign-in if it’s been determined that an email exists in the auth profile in RTP|One for that pass.
Open image-20240513-191724.png
Account exists, sign in
If a guest enters a valid pass number, but the pass is not associated with an email, Aspenware will prevent the guest from signing up with that pass. This safeguard ensures that individuals who may have found or obtained someone else's pass cannot create an account with it.
In these cases, guests will be prompted to contact the resort for assistance in verifying and linking their pass to their account.
Open image-20240513-191821.png
No email to verify
Biomentrics Login
Biometrics are measurable, unique human traits—such as facial features or fingerprints—that applications can use to verify a person's identity. With biometric authentication, users can add an additional layer of security to their accounts, complementing traditional email and password logins. For more information, see
Biometrics Login
.
Bot Detection
Auth0 provides built-in bot detection and protection against unauthorized login attempts that can be enabled for partner resorts. When suspicious activity is detected, such as from certain IP addresses, Auth0 will prompt the user with a simple challenge, such as checking a box to confirm they are human.
Single Sign-On
Single Sign-On
Single Sign-On, or SSO is enabled with Aspenware. In the instance of a Resort Group with multiple resorts, a single guest can create credentials at one resort and use those same credentials across all related resorts, as long as the tenant is setup to do so.
Multi-Store SSO
Identity v3 will allow resort groups that utilize a shared Commerce instance to host multiple stores. This applies to various configurations:
Themes are applied per store
GTM IDs are applied per store
Logins are applied per store
Rewards
The Rewards module in RTP|One is integrated with Aspenware Identity v3 (Powered by Auth0). If a resort chooses to enable a rewards program, an enrollment checkbox will appear during the customer profile creation process. When selected, this will communicate directly with RTP|One and set the guest's enrollment status to "true" in the Rewards module.
Please note that the resort must configure their Rewards module in RTP|One before Aspenware can activate this feature in the sign-up flow.
Google Analytics
We have added Google Analytics tracking to Identity v3. For more information on the specific additions to the data layer, see
Identify v3 (Powered by Auth0) Configuration Guide
.
Monitoring & Alerting
Aspenware has implemented performance monitoring using Application Insights. Internal teams at Aspenware will receive alerts if any performance issues arise, such as multiple sign-in failures (e.g., 10 failures within 5 minutes). Aspenware regularly evaluates system performance to identify trends and works closely with Auth0 to continuously improve the platform, ensuring optimal performance for resort partners.
How will we alert the resort?
Aspenware will notify the resort if there are any significant performance issues affecting Identity v3.
During office hours
Customer Success Representative to notify resort after being notified via Slack.
After office hours
On-call Representative will notify resort after being notified via Slack.
3rd Party Applications
All existing (and new) 3rd party applications from Identity v2 are may be added to Identity v3. See the
Identify v3 (Powered by Auth0) Configuration Guide
for details about setup of this feature.
Aspenware will provide documentation and consultation if/when resorts wish to migrate their applications to using Identity v3 (Powered by
Auth0)
. Please
contact
your Aspenware Service Agent for more information.
Theming
Aspenware will theme the resort Auth0 pages based on the criteria submitted via Theme Designer. If the resort is a current Aspenware customer, most of the information can be utilized from Identity v2, but some new information will be required.
Theming the Auth0 pages will be part of the resort implementation process. All requests will go through the Aspenware Team and they will be responsible for setting up the initial theme on the resort Identity v3 pages once the tenant is setup.

Q: If someone calls to troubleshoot their account, how can my support staff still help?
2
Q: What happens if the password strength I setup in Auth0 is ‘stronger’ than what I originally setup in Identity?

Q: Can I customize my emails?
7

8
Q: What happens if I need to revert back to IDv2?
9
Q: Does IDv3 work for multi-store?
Q: If someone calls to troubleshoot their account, how can my support staff still help?
A: Credentials will still be stored in RTP and you will be able to change their password or username/email as you always have done in the past. Once credentials are migrated out of RTP, AW will setup a tool to allow the Resort team to reset passwords and view username/emails.
Q: What happens if the password strength I setup in Auth0 is ‘stronger’ than what I originally setup in Identity?
A: Nothing adverse will happen to the guest. Auth0 will not validate if the password meets the new requirements if those credentials were in place prior to the transition to Auth0.
Q: What if I use Inntopia to send emails?
A: Inntopia is not supported in Auth0 as an SMTP provider. It is strongly recommended that you utilize Sendgrid to send Auth0 emails or any other supported SMTP provider (noted above in this documentation).
Q: What happens once I turn Auth0 on?
A: The existing Identity pages will still be present but the guests will be routed to the new Auth0 login URL (which can be the same as the identity page). If credentials are still being stored in RTP, the auth profile in RTP will continue to be populated with email and password for the guest.
Q: Can I customize my theme?
A: Yes. There are limits to what can be branded as noted in the theming section.
Q: Can I customize my emails?
A: Yes. We can leverage the templates in Auth0 to customize email content, but cannot use HTML.
Q: Can I customize the error messages?
A: Yes. We are allowing minimal customizations to occur on various error messages as they can be tied to specific metrics we are tracking based on the content.
Q: What happens if I need to revert back to IDv2?
A: Ideally, we will endeavor to fix any issues in IDv3 but do have the ability to roll-back to IDv2 in extreme circumstances.
Q: Does IDv3 work for multi-store?
A: Yes. All IDv3 configurations are on a per store basis. There are limited theming options per store on the login pages and any Google Analytics events can be tied per store.

Biometrics are measurable, unique human traits—such as facial features or fingerprints—that applications can use to verify a person's identity. With biometric authentication, users can add an additional layer of security to their accounts, complementing traditional email and password logins.
Key features include:
Broad Device Support:
Enable biometric login through popular methods like Face ID and Touch ID on iOS devices (iPhones, iPads, and Macs), Touch ID and fingerprint scanning on Android devices, and compatible technologies on Windows machines.
A Secure and Convenient Authentication Factor:
The availability of compatible devices capable of reliably measuring human traits has grown exponentially, increasing the popularity of biometric authentication in enterprise and customer applications.
Goals of Biometric Authentication:
Modernize Authentication:
Offer cutting-edge, user-centric methods to enhance the guest experience.
Minimize Errors:
Reduce reliance on passwords, lowering the risk of sign-in errors and forgotten credentials.
Strengthen Security:
Provide a robust authentication layer to safeguard user accounts.
User Journey
A user can enroll one device per type (mobile, tablet, or desktop) for biometrics, with a maximum of three devices in total. When a new device is enrolled for a specific type, it replaces the previous one. For example, enrolling a work phone will override a personal phone's biometric enrollment. Only the most recently enrolled device of each type will work with biometrics.
Once Biometrics is enabled, the the login and sign-up flows will be altered.
A user who is signing in for the first time since Biometrics enablement, will first provide an email, and then once they select ‘continue,' they will be prompted with the password.
Open image-20250218-231831.png
If they are enrolling for the first time, after they authenticate, they will be prompted to enroll in Biometrics.  This will occur at login and sign-up.  For login, it will occur after the user authenticates with their password.  For sign-up, this will occur after they have completed the sign-up flow (after creating their customer where they entered their name, DOB, phone, and zip). For a list of current device support for device biometrics, please see this
list
.
The user is presented three options:
Proceed to the devices biometrics authentication.
Select ‘remind me later’ and they will not be prompted for two weeks (Once the two weeks passes, the user can then enroll if they are asked to sign back in)
Select ‘not on this device’ they will not be prompted for another year.
A user who is signing in for the first time since Biometrics enablement, will first provide an email, and then once they select ‘continue,' they will be prompted with the password.
If the user selects continue, they will be prompted with the biometrics verification, either a fingerprint or a face ID from the device.
Open image-20250218-173031.png
Once authenticated by the device, the user will then be shown a success screen, and can click “Continue” to proceed.
If a user is already enrolled, they will be prompted with the below screen.

Detailed Setup Guide
When a resort first onboards with Identity v3 (Powered by Auth0), Aspenware can enable biometrics during implementation. There is no configuration for the resort to complete on their own, everything is configured in the Auth0 tenant setup.
If a resort is already on Identity v3 (Powered by Auth0) and wants to enable biometrics at any point, simply
send a request
to the Customer Success Team and they will work with you to enable biometrics.
Un-Enrolling Users
If a user ever wants to un-enroll, they can do so, but first they must contact the resort. The resort will then need to
submit a ticket to Customer Success
, and if given access, can reset the user's MFA. The resort must provide the following information to Aspenware:
Which tenant the user is a part of (Resort)
User’s name and email address to ensure they have the correct user
The resort will then reset the user’s MFA, thereby removing biometrics from their profile.

6
Q: Why can a user log in with a pin when this is not a unique human trait?
Q: If a user is enrolled in biometrics, and they change their email, do they need to re-enroll?
A: Users do not need to re-enroll. The new email is tied to the device and they can still sign in using biometrics with the new email as they did previously.
Q: What happens if they forgot their password?
A: Nothing changes for using biometrics, your device is technically working with Identity v3 to create a secure passkey during enrollment that will be used during sign-in.  If you decide to use your password instead, the user will need to reset their password.
Q: When a user logs in on a new device why are they not immediately prompted to set up Biometrics?
A: Once a password is entered on a new device, the next time the user logs in, they will be prompted to set up Biometrics.  For more details see
Auth0's documentation on device recognition.
Q: Can password managers be used with Biometrics?
A: Yes they can! However, password managers introduce possible issues. One known issue is with Bitwarden.
[learn more here]
Q: Can a user unenroll from Biometrics?
A: If a user ever wants to un-enroll, they can do so, but first they must contact the resort. The resort will then need to
submit a ticket to Customer Success
.
Q: Why can a user log in with a pin when this is not a unique human trait?
A: Identity v3 is powered by Auth0, and technically this feature will allow login with whatever your device says it supports via WebAuthn. Sometimes that can be your face or fingerprint, other times it might be a PIN.  See above documents for more information.

OpenAPI Specs
Overview
This feature enables a resort to connect users from their customer data platform (CDP) to accounts in Aspenware’s Identity v3. This connection can be used to associate customer records in a resort system with the associated customer in Aspenware during login or sign-up. It allows custom resort apps to leverage Aspenware authentication more seamlessly.
Prerequisites
A resort must be on Identity v3 and create a Custom Claim API endpoint as per the instructions below, in order to use this integration.
How does it work?
This feature is built on an integration method called a Custom Claim hook, which is a payload of information that is added to a secure access token.
During the login or sign-up process, Identity v3 will make a server-side
POST
request to a hook endpoint provided by the resort. Aspenware will send user profile data including an RTP IPCode. In response, the hook can return plain text (structured or otherwise) that will be placed in a custom claim called
customIntegration
. This value can then be read by any
relying parties
.
Example
A practical example of this integration is within a resort’s native mobile app. The resort does not have its own accounts/login system, but wants to leverage the same login that’s present on its Aspenware store. The resort’s mobile app will also integrate with a proprietary loyalty system, as well as the resort’s lodging platform.
In order to reduce latency and simplify customer lookup requests, the resort can create a Custom Claims endpoint that integrates with this feature.
Behind this endpoint, the resort queries its CDP to find a lodging user id and the loyalty system user id associated with the person logging in. These third-party identifiers get embedded in Aspenware’s Identity v3 access token. Post-login, the native mobile app can trust these identifiers and use them to deliver a personalized experience.
API Endpoint Requirements
The integrating service’s API endpoint must meet the following requirements:
Maximum response latency: 500 milliseconds
Content type: Anything that can be parsed as
plain text
Maximum content size: 1KB
If the response does not meet any of these requirements,
no claim
will be created and the user
will continue
through the login process (failing open). If the endpoint does not return a
200
status code, it will be treated as an error and no claim will be created.
Additional details about the hook, including the request body schema are in the OpenAPI specs section below.
Use of PII Data
The use case for sharing the guests’ PII (first name, last name, email, phone, zip) is focused on the following scenario:
A new user creates an account on Aspenware and the resort CDP doesn’t have any information about this user yet. Aspenware includes PII in the call so that the external system has something with which it can construct a profile immediately, without an additional query back to the source of truth (RTP).
When existing users log in, if the external system has a matching customer with the Aspenware provided
posCustomerId
, then the PII data should be retrieved from the source of truth, which is the POS.
This is important to note in the integration logic because Aspenware data should not be considered the source of truth and will not be 100% up to date if changes are made to first name, last name, phone or zip in the POS. The email address will be kept up to date however, as that is used for login.
If an account merge occurs in the POS, the RTP IPcode of an Aspenware user will be updated at the next login
.
Configurations
Please work with your
Aspenware Customer Success
in order to implement this feature. On a per-Identity v3
environment
basis, we will need to know the
following
:
Configuration Name
Description
Examples
Configuration Name
Description
Examples
Custom claim endpoint URL
The URL that Identity v3 will send the API request to.
https://example.com/api/get-user-claims
Authorization header name
The header name that the auth value will be put in to authenticate the request. This will typically be
Authorization
.
Authorization
,
X-API-KEY
Authorization header value
The constant value that will be placed in the header to authenticate the request.
My API Key
,
Bearer abc123=
Multi-Store Configurations
There is no extra support for multi-store configurations. All hook configuration values are shared across the Identity v3 tenant.
Authentication
Currently, the only supported authentication type is akin to an API key. You can specify a name and value that Identity v3 will include in the header of its requests.

Airline passengers have been programmed to check-in 24 hours prior to their flights for years now. This allows the airline to capture information on the guest, saves time at the airport, and gives travelers peace of mind that their experience at the airport will be smooth. Aspenware Arrival provides this experience for guests coming to ski and ride at the resort. Guests can check in prior to arriving at the resort.

Resort Tools reduces time spent waiting in line for guests and time spent by resort staff checking guests in across your resort.
Overview
Resort Tools encompasses two products that can be used in one of two ways or in tandem for the optimal onsite guest experience. The two offerings are as follows:
Resort Tools - Kiosk
Resort Tools - Kiosk
is designed for guests to complete the required information at a resort kiosk Our user-facing kiosk is designed to capture required information in your rental stores, pass offices and lesson locations. The streamlined user flow is designed for ease of use and accurate customer profiles. Resorts mitigate risk with the careful completion and collection of required documents.
All guests at a particular location will be guided through the same process, which is optimized for that location. The product can operate without an internet connection if configured for offline use. Guests can use a fast-flow option with pre-filled information, but personalization based on guest data and order details is unavailable. If personalization is important,
Aspenware Arrival
may be a better option. To use Resort Tools - Kiosk, a Resort Tools or Aspenware Arrival license is required.

Resort Tools - Waiver Tablets (Guest Check-In)
Resort Tools - Waiver Tablets (Guest Check-In) enables guests to complete required information onsite. This tool enables the signing of waivers, the ability to email waivers to non-present attendees, the option to opt into marketing communications, and the ability to capture and upload a photo.

Orders Creation in SWEB from RTP Sales Transactions

Ongoing Support and Maintenance
This solution supports the use of the SKIDATA Skiosk to print media from an RTP order or sales transaction.  Sales that contain deferred printable media from RTP are uploaded to SKIDATA’s SWEB tool which can then be printed on the Skiosk.  Once printed, SKIDATA sends the RFID back to RTP and marks the media as printed.  The media can then be used for validation in RTP.
Solution Overview
There are 4 main aspects to this solution.  1) SKIDATA DTA/SWEB, 2) Unity Contractor Service, 3) Unity DTA Jobs, and 4) RTP.
Open image-20230425-162904.png
SKIDATA DTA/SWEB
SKIDATA provides access to SWEB during the implementation and will also provide training on the tool.  Typically SWEB is accessed often during the initial implementation phase to verify interfaced products and orders but then less after go-live.  The interface between Aspenware and SKIDATA only uses a small portion of SWEB which is also used with SKIDATAs POS and parking system.
SKIDTA Skiosks
This is the hardware that prints RFID cards (shown above).
DTA
This is the name of the interface used by a 3rd party system to interact with SKIDATA’s system.
SWEB
SWEB is the name of the user interface used by the SKIDATA Skiosks and can be used to view interfaced products and orders.  The printing template the Skiosks use is also defined in SWEB.
Open image-20230425-181722.png
Unity Contactor Service
The Unity Contractor Service is an Aspenware-created Windows IIS application that is installed locally at the resort. The application is used for for 2 purposes which are to create products in SKIDATA’s SWEB application (via the catalog import function) and to upload the RFID from the Skiosk back into RTP and to mark the media as printed.
An RTP Client Code is defined in the SKIDATA SWEB tool which is used in the catalog import process to lookup products in RTP that are eligible to be printed on the Skoisk.  A product is created in SWEB for each RTP product and a mapping is automatically defined to the RTP product header code.  Only products that are interfaced to SWEB through the catalog import process are then eligible to printed on the Skiosks.  Once printed, SWEB sends the RFID back to the Unity Contractor Service where it is uploaded into RTP’s ExternalAccessMap table and the media is marked as printed in the TransactionProductOutput table.
Unity DTA Jobs
The Unity DTA Jobs service is also an Aspenware-created Windows IIS application that is installed locally at the resort.  This application polls RTP’s TransactionProductOutput table every minute for new records.  Only transactions with products that have previously been interfaced to SKIDATA’s SWEB tool (via the catalog import) will be picked up by the service and sent to SKIDATA to create an order.  An Order is created in SWEB with a reference to the RTP Sales Transaction ID, Order ID or External Order ID which is used to retrieve the order and print (usually from a QR or barcode).
RTP
RTP sales transactions and fulfilled orders that contain deferred media of season pass and access products are eligible to be printed on the Skiosks.  As mentioned previously, the products must first be included in the catalog import process and interfaced to SWEB before a sales transaction or fulfilled order containing deferred media will be created in SWEB as an Order.
RTP Client Code
The RTP Client Code defined in SWEB will be used by the catalog import to lookup which products meet the criteria to be included in the import process.
Products must be priced in RTP for the day the catalog import runs.
An existing RTP Client Code can be used or a new one can be created.  The Sale Location assigned to the Client in RTP can also be an existing sale location or a new one dedicated to a new Skiosk Location.  The benefit of using a new sale location is that products could be priced for all dates.  If products are only priced for part of the year, it is likely multiple catalog imports will need to be performed in order to interface those products to SWEB making transactions and orders that contain these products eligible to be printed on the Skiosks.  If products are available all season, then it is possible only a single catalog import will need to be run at the beginning of the season.
The Client Code will also be uploaded into several RTP tables as the client code that printed the media (i.e. TransactionProductOutput.OutputClientCode).
Detailed Setup Guide
The following instructions detail the setup steps for using the SKIDATA Skiosk to print media from an RTP order or sales transaction.
Set Up SWEB Contractor
Import SWEB Catalog
Configure SWEB Print Mask (Media Template)
Install Aspenware IIS Application
Test UnityDTAJobs Install
Trigger Sending of RTP Transactions to SKIDATA/SWEB
Select Testing Method
Add Rules to Product Header Codes
Go Live
1. Set Up SWEB Contractor
The Unity Contractor Service URL is define in SWEB which is where SKIDATA will configure a Contractor entry. Aspenware will provide the URL to the Unity Contractor Service once it is setup or will add the URL to SWEB.  This can be found in SWEB in Sales Management / Tenants / Contractors.
Following is an example from Aspenware’s test environment.
Edit the Contractor entry and then navigate to the Contractor System tab to define the URL.

2. Click ‘Check Connectivity’ to test the connection from SKIDATA’s SWEB tool to the Unity Contractor Service installed locally at the resort.  The URL format is below but will differ for each install =
https://servername.com/UnityContractorService/ContractorService.svc
Open image-20230425-203735.png
Open image-20230502-153641.png
2. Import SWEB Catalog
SKIDATA will configure portions of SWEB prior to the first catalog import.  The catalog import can be found in SWEB in Sales Management > Configuration > Catalogs and there is typically only one entry created for the resort.  The RTP Client Code that will be used to lookup products in RTP is defined in the External ID field (see below).  At least one catalog import will need to be completed prior to any attempt to print from the Skiosks.
Open image-20230425-202054.png
To start the catalog import, click the
Import
button along the top ribbon. Then click
Start Import
.
Open image-20230425-202607.png
2. The import process only takes a few seconds.  To view the products imported, click the Products button along the top ribbon.
Open image-20230425-202713.png
3. If the import was successful, products will show in the list.  Use the gear/settings icon to show the External Id column which shows the RTP Product Header code.
Open image-20230425-202911.png
3. Configure SWEB Print Mask (Media Template)
The catalog import also configures a Print Mask in SWEB which is the media template that prints when a Skiosk order is fulfilled.  This is located in Sales Management > Configuration > Print Masks.  Each time the catalog imports runs, the print mask gets set back to the default which some customers do not use.
It is recommended to define the Print Mask during testing and then to export the template from SWEB and then re-import after each catalog import.
The default template pulls a description from one of the Unity Contractor Service configuration files so this could be used to define a short text line on the template (e.g., Winter 22-23).  Some customers use this and therefore need to remember to update the configuration file after each season.  Each time the configuration file is updated, a catalog import will need to be performed to add the new descriptions to SWEB.  The text is located in the web.config file in the DTA ticketText field.  Additional information can be found on this in the install section of this guide.
Open image-20230425-210309.png
Double click the entry above to edit the template.
Open image-20230425-211351.png
2. To export the template, click
Miscellaneous
in the upper right corner and then the
Export
button.  This will download a JSON file that can be used to import the template using the same method after the next catalog import.
Open image-20230425-211446.png
3. To import, click the
Import Template
button.
Open image-20230425-211609.png
4. Install Aspenware IIS Application
Aspenware will perform 2 installations on Unity in conjunction with this implementation.
Install Unity Contractor Service
Aspenware will install the Unity Contractor Service on a server at the resort that is accessible to the SKIDATA web services.  SKIDATA will provide the IP range of the traffic so that the server can be locked down.  The Unity Contractor Service is an IIS application that is accessed by SKIDATA for the catalog import function and to upload printed RFID’s to RTP.
The following config/json files contain all the configuration values needed for the service.
Rtp-config.json
– contains all RTP configuration values
SalesChannelCode:
Sales channel used for the product catalog import.  Products need to be priced for the day the catalog imports runs and to have output added in RTP for the sales channel defined.
UserID
: This must be a valid user with a valid UserSession.SessionToken in RTP.  This user will be the OperatorID that printed the media in several RTP database tables.
Database Connection string (server, db, SQL user)
: Aspenware will create a new SQL Role and User and the Role needs to have privileges to the following tables.  Aspenware can configure this in SSMS or provide a script.
GRANT SELECT ON  [dbo].[TransactionProductOutput] TO [awdtarole]
GRANT UPDATE ON  [dbo].[TransactionProductOutput] TO [awdtarole]
GRANT SELECT ON  [dbo].[TransactionLineOriginalTransactionLine] TO [awdtarole]

ClientCode
: Client code used for product catalog import.
SaleLocationCode
: Sale location used for the product catalog import.
AuditLocationCod
e: Not used but set to the same location code above.
Web.config
– contains additional setup data
Skiosks:
Defines mapping for SKIDATA Skiosk and RTP Client code.  This client code will be updated in RTP’s TransactionProductOutput.OutputClientCode column as the client that printed the output and shows in various places in RTP.  Currently on a single mapping is supported by SKIDATA.  Define the SKIDATA Sales Channel name to map to the RTP client code in this section.
Open image-20230502-153258.png
ticketText:
Text data is imported during catalog import to SWEB/Print Mask, ‘Text Print Mask Item 1’. If text is changed directly in SWEB, data will be overwritten with text defined in web.config in next catalog import.  If this media element is not added to the Print Mask in SWEB, there is no need to update this from season to season.
priceCategoryName:
Text data is imported during catalog import to SWEB/Price Category.  This description does not show during fulfillment but does show in SKIDATA admin.  Typically this description is set to match the same description of ticketText above.
seasonStartDate
&
seasonEndDate:
Dates are imported during catalog import to SWEB/Time Periods.  Aspenware recommends defining a large data range to avoid having to update each season since this data only shows in SKIDATA admin.

Test the Unity Contractor Service install by entering the URL into a browser to verify a service page displays instead of an error page.
Example of URL:
https://aspenware.com/UnityContractorService/ContractorService.svc
Install Unity DTA Jobs
Aspenware will install the Unity DTA Jobs on a server at the resort that is accessible to the SKIDATA DTA web services.  SKIDATA will provide the IP range of the traffic so that the server can be locked down.  The Unity DTA Jobs is an IIS application that is used to look up transactions in RTP that have deferred output and to create orders in SKIDATA’s SWEB application.  Microsoft’s dotnet-hosting will also need to be installed on the server hosting the UnityDTAJobs application.
The UnityDTA Jobs service uses Hangfire which is a 3rd party product used to perform background processing in .NET and .NET Core applications.  Hangfire has several database tables that will also need to be deployed which are described below.
Install UnityDTAJobs database
Aspenware has scripts to install the UnityDTAJobs database which also include database tables for Hangfire.  These tables track which RTP transactions have been sent to SKIDATA/SWEB.  See below for screenshot of the tables included in the UnityDTAJobs database.
Open image-20230509-145344.png
Configure UnityDTAJobs
The following config/json files contain all the configuration values needed for the UnityDTAJobs service.
appsettings.json

UserID:
This must be a valid user with a valid UserSession.SessionToken in RTP.  This user will be added to transactions that have been interfaced to SKIDATA SWEB.
Database Connection string (server, db, SQL user):
Aspenware creates a new SQL Role and User and the Role needs to have SELECT privileges to the following tables.  Aspenware can configure this in SSMS or provide a script.
GRANT SELECT ON  [dbo].[TransactionProductOutput] TO [awdtarole]
GRANT UPDATE ON  [dbo].[TransactionProductOutput] TO [awdtarole]

GRANT SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE ON SCHEMA :: dta TO [awdtarole]
5. Test UnityDTAJobs Install
Once installed, navigate to
http://localhost/UnityDTAJobs/hangfire/
in a browser on the machine hosting the application.  If the install was successful, the Hangfire Dashboard should show rather than an error page.  The Realtime Graph below shows the number of transactions processed and the History Graph shows the total uptime of the Hangfire service.
Open image-20230502-183550.png
6. Trigger Sending RTP Transactions to SKIDATA/SWEB
The UnityDTAJobs IIS application uses the dta.LastProcessedTransaction table to track the transactions that have already been sent to SKIDATA.  During the implementation, the ProcessDate will be set to a date in the past and will begin processing once the IIS application is started.  Once the date catches up to the current date, only new transactions containing deferred output will be processed moving forward.
Open image-20230502-184200.png
Every RTP transaction is reviewed by the service to see if there is any deferred output that meets the criteria to be sent to SKIDATA to create an order.  The criteria is that the product in the transaction has been previously interfaced to SKIDATA using the product catalog import and that the product has the Rule, ‘Skidata Print PUB’ added (See rules information below).  Each RTP transaction ID that meets the criteria, will be created in SWEB as an Order and the DTAOrderID will be recorded in the dta.Reservation table.
Open image-20230502-184402.png
The DTAOrderID will also be updated into RTP’s TransactionHeader table in the OfflineTransactionID field.
Open image-20230509-150511.png
Below shows an Order in SWEB created from RTP Transaction ID, 101525809.  If the order originated from an Aspenware online order, the ConfirmationNumber will be the RTP ExternalOrderID (i.e. PK12345).
Open image-20230502-184727.png
7. Select Testing Method
It is possible to point all the services to RTPOneTest to perform testing but it is easier to test against RTPOne prod instead.  The main issue with using RTPOneTest is that SKIDATA does not have a test system so it’s possible that an RTP TransactionID that was interfaced to SKIDATA/SWEB during testing from RTPOneTest will exist in RTPOne production as a real customer’s TransactionID.  The SKIDATA development team can clear out orders that were created during testing but using the method below against RTPOne prod is preferred for testing.
Below is an outline to perform initial testing without interfacing all RTP transactions to SKIDATA SWEB.
Set the dta.LastProcessedTransaction table to have a ProcessDate of today for all rows.
Recycle the UnityDTAJobs application pool (or start the service).
Create or clone an RTP Product Header that contains media output that has never been sold to a customer and add all three Skiosk related Rules (Unity Attribute - Age, Unity Attribute - Duration, and SkiData Print on PUB).
In SKIDATA SWEB, start the product catalog import and verify the new product shows up
If no product, review the SWEB DTA Transaction Logs for any errors.
If no errors in DTA Transaction Logs, review the UnityContractorService log
If no errors in the UnityContractorService log, start SQL trace to see call hitting RTP and manually run in SSMS.  This may reveal that the product does not meet the criteria to be interfaced (pricing, sales channel, sale location, etc).
In RTP, create a sales transaction and sell the product created in step 1 above.  Make sure to defer media during the sale.
In SWEB, make sure you see an Order show up within a minute or two.
If no order in SWEB, verify the UnityDTAJobs IIS application is running (verify the application pool is started).
If UnityDTAJobs is running, check error log.
If no errors, verify there is deferred output in RTP’s Deferred Output Tool.
Check the UnityDTAJobs table, dta.Reservation for the most recent entries to see if there are errors.
Create a barcode or QR code of the RTP TransactionID and attempt to use at Skiosk.
If nothing prints, re-verify the Transactions is in SWEB as an Order
If Order exists but nothing prints, ask SKIDATA to check the Skiosk log (which is located directly on the PC inside the Skiosk hardware.
If media prints, verify the RFID can be used to perform a search in RTP.
If RFID cannot be searched successfully in RTP, look for errors in the UnityContractorService log.
Repeat steps above for an RTP OrderID that is manually created and fulfilled in RTP and for an online order.
For an Order created directly in RTP, use the RTP OrderID as the barcode/QR code at the Skiosk.
For an online order, use the RTP ExternalOrderID as the barcode/QR code at the Skiosk.
8. Add Rules to Product Header Code(s)
Three Product Header Rules need to be added to any product that will be printed from the Skiosk.
IMPORTANT
:
DO NOT ADD THESE RULES UNTIL GO-LIVE.
More info on this can be found in the testing section of this document below.
Rule 1: Unity Attribute - Duration
Add Duration rule to Product Header Codes per the diagram and define a value of 1.
Open image-20230613-212505.png
Duration Rule
Rule 2: Unity Attribute - Age
Add Age rule to Product Header Codes per the diagram and define a value of 1.
Open image-20230613-212816.png
Age Rule
Rule 3: SkiData Print on PUB
Add SkiData Print on PUB Rule to Product Header Codes and define a value of TRUE.
Open image-20230613-213139.png
SKIDATA Print on PUB Rule
Open image-20230425-182209.png
Example of Rules added to PHC
Configure Product components to have Output and to Allow Deferral.
NOTE
: If after go-live, the resort realizes they did not add the three Rules to all products, the catalog import can be run again and the ProcessDate in the dta.LastProcessedTransaction can be set back to a date in the past.  The service will run and skip over any transaction it has already processed and only create orders in SWEB for transactions containing the new products.  This process will also take a few hours because every transaction is reviewed again by the service.
9. Go Live
Going live with the Skiosks means ensuring all products in RTP have the three rules added and then setting the ProcessDate in the dta.LastProcessedTransaction to a date in the past.  If the testing method above was followed, there should be no need to clear out data in the dta.Reservation table.
Stop the UnityDTAJobs application pool.
Ensure the 3 product header rules have been added to all products.
(SEE SECTION ABOVE)
Start the product catalog import in SWEB
Ask the resort to review the list of products.  If products are missing, ask the resort to add the three Rules to additional products and/or verify the product(s) are priced for ‘today'.
Repeat this step until the resort verifies all products are showing in SWEB.
Set the dta.LastProcessedTransaction table to have a ProcessDate in the past.  This should be the date of or right before the date they started selling media products for the season.
Start the UnityDTAJobs application pool.
Verify Orders are showing in SKIDATA SWEB.  This process can take a few hours depending on how far back the date goes and how many total transaction's the resort has.
To verify the initial load of Orders is complete, verify the ProcessDate for the Reservation column now shows today’s date.
Orders Creation in SWEB from RTP Sales Transactions
The Unity DTA Service is always running in the customer’s environment and is looking for new RTP transactions that contain deferred pass media and access output.  The products in these transactions need to have the Product Header Rule, SkiData Print On PUB and the products must currently be in SWEB from a catalog import.  If all these conditions are met, an Order gets created in SWEB which can be viewed in Sales Management > Monitoring > Orders (see below).  Once the Order is created in SWEB, it can then be printed from the Skiosk.
If an order or is cancelled in RTP or the fulfillment transactions has been returned, the order is then cancelled in SKIDATA/SWEB and cannot be printed.
The ‘Confirmation Number’ that appears in SWEB will be the RTP Sales Transaction ID if the deferred output is associated with an RTP sales transaction (completed directly in RTP), an RTP OrderID if the deferred output originated from an RTP order (completed directly in  RTP), or the ExternalOrderID if the sale originated from an Aspenware order (or any 3rd party processing orders into RTP).
This is the only value mapped to the SKIDATA Order and is the only value that can be used to find and print the order on the Skiosk.
In other words, for an Aspenware order, only the ExternalOrderID will get mapped to the Order in SWEB so only that value can be used to find the order and print the media from the Skiosk.  The RTP OrderID from Aspenware’s order cannot be used to find the order in SWEB.
Open image-20230425-223635.png
Ongoing Support and Maintenance
Depending on the products being printed on the Skiosks, additional product catalog imports may need to be run in the future.  Some resorts have very few products that haven’t changed from year to year so they may have only used the catalog import function during the initial implementation.  Resorts that are not bundling media with access on product headers may have very few media product headers and therefore very few interfaced products in SKIDATA/SWEB.  Resorts that bundle media and access may have dozens or hundreds of products interfaced to SKIDATA/SWEB.
The key thing to remember is that ‘todays’ date is used when the catalog import runs so if a resort does not have pricing setup until their opening date (i.e. 11/15/2024), then running the catalog import in October will not interface products to SKIDATA/SWEB.
As mentioned above, each time the catalog import is run in SWEB, the Print Mask resets back to the default so if the resort isn’t using the default, they will need to import the Print Mask file after each import.

The Aspenware Scanning application integrates into RTP’s access control system and can be used to process online and offline scans.  The application runs on handheld devices running Android kitkat up to version 11 of Android  (version 4.4 to version 11) which also have the DataWedge application (typically Zebra devices).  The devices connect via http or https to a server within the resorts internal local area network (LAN) running Aspenware’s Unity API.  Unity then communicates to the RTP database on the resorts LAN to verify scanning data and retrieve customer information.  The Unity API can be installed on the existing RTP application server or on another server located within the resort’s LAN.
The devices should be configured on the resorts local area network (LAN) and not a through a public wireless access point.  The devices should not have access to the internet, and it is the resorts responsibility to secure access to the scanner data and network traffic.  It is also recommended to disable Bluetooth and any cellular networks on the device.
There are 3 main aspects of this solution, 1) Android Device (AWScanning.apk), 2) Unity, and 3) RTP
Open image-20210512-191746.png
Settings Overview
The Aspenware Scanning application settings allow configuring the device behavior on the Login page and when scanning barcodes and reading RFID media cards.  The Login page can be configured to require scanning barcodes/RFID cards in order to sign-in as well as to require the user of a valid RTP UserID.  To gain access to the device settings, manually enter or scan a barcode of the word, ‘SETTINGS’.  This will automatically display the settings page on the device.
Open image-20210512-191826.png
Open image-20210512-191832.png
Web Service
– defines connectivity information for the device to connect to Unity.
Device
– defines DeviceID as well as behavior of the Login page.  See below for more info on each setting.
Sound Settings
– defines sound and vibration settings for offline, validate only and live  scans.  See below for more info on sound settings.
UHF Scan Settings
– only displays on a device that is configured to use UHF.  These settings control the default trigger mode, range of the UHF reader and RFID conversion type.  See below for more info on each setting.
Settings - Web Service
Open image-20210512-192136.png
The web service URL must be entered in the following format including the trailing slash:  https://<servername>/Unity/ (i.e.
https://aspenwarecommerce.net/UnityProd/
)
Client Id – defined during implementation. Do not change.
Client Secret – defined during implementation. Do not change.
Settings - Device Settings
The login page is configurable through Device Settings to allow the following options.
Open image-20210512-192223.png
Device ID
– defines the ID used to record scans in RTP.  Recommend defining a unique Device ID per device.
Require Location Scan
– determines whether user can manually select Access Location or if scanning a barcode is required to sign-in.  If set to Y, user must scan a valid AccessLocationCode from RTP (i.e barcode of 100, 110, 120, etc.)
Validate UserID
– determines whether username is a validated against RTP.  If enabled, a valid RTP UserID must be used to sign-in.
Force Login Scan
– determines whether a user must scan a pass media barcode or read an RFID card to sign-in.  If enabled, the RTP IPCode the pass belongs to must be added to a UserID in Admin/Security Administration/User in RTP:
Open image-20210512-192321.png
Enable Add Customer ID
–enables functionality to allow operator to enter an RTP Customer ID (IPCode) when a certain RTP Access Error is returned as a scan result.  After entering customer ID, a new scan will be triggered that appends the {CustomerID} to the end of the previously scanned code.
Customer ID Scan Code –
click to enter a specific RTP Access Error ‘Error Message’ for the Enable Add Customer ID functionality.  This will be the only RTP Access Error that will trigger this functionality to allow an operator to enter a Customer ID (IPCode).  For example, ‘Bad Type’ is entered below so when this scan result is returned to the scanner, the ‘Add Customer ID’ option will display allowing the operator to enter an RTP IPCode.
Open image-20210512-192356.png
After scan occurs that returns this type, the Add Customer ID button appears:
Open image-20210512-192410.png
Which allows the operator to enter data which then gets appended to the previously scanned code and triggers a new scan:
Open image-20210512-192424.png
Date entered gets appended (444 was entered to trigger the scan below:
Open image-20210512-192434.png
Settings - Device Settings
Adjust Date Format settings to allow the device to display different date formats.
Open image-20210512-192508.png
Open image-20210512-192550.png
Settings - Sound Settings
Sound settings define the sound generated for an Offline, Validate Only and Live Scan on the device.  Several sounds are delivered in each category and custom sounds can also be uploaded as of v1.14 of the app.  You can also define whether the device vibrates with each type of sound by checking the Vibrate checkbox.
For Live Scans, ‘Beep’ settings are used to map to valid and invalid scans from RTP Access Rule Product Type administration.  Settings for 1 and 3 Beeps are delivered with the device and map to a valid and invalid scan from RTP (3 is always an invalid scan in RTP).  Additional Beeps can be added which map to RTP’s Access Rule Product Type administration entries.  To add new Beeps, click the ‘New Setting’ button below and define an un-used Beep Count, Sound and Vibrate setting.  ‘4 Beeps’ has been added in the screen shot below.  After adding a new setting, you must click the ‘Save Settings’ button.
Open image-20210512-192832.png
To upload custom sounds
, place a .wav file in the devices Notification directory and select the custom sound file when defining new beeps or when editing the Offline and/or Validate Only settings.  For example, in the screen shots below, the ‘LightningSound.wav’ was uploaded to the device making it available to select through the app.

Settings - UHF Scan Settings
The UHF Scan Settings are configurable to allow adjusting the default behavior of the trigger, the transmit power of the device as well as the type of RFID’s populated into the device.
Open image-20230118-223307.png
Open image-20230118-223228.png
Trigger Mode
Barcode and RFID – allows the scanner to scan barcodes and read RFID tags.  When this is enabled, a barcode will be read first even if an RFID tag is in range.
RFID Only – only allows the scanner to scan RFID tags.
Use Max Transmit Power
– impacts the range of the scanner.  When enabled, the max range of the device will be used to scan RFID tags.  The max range for the Zebra MC3300 is 270 but this can differ per device.  This value is a numeric value that relates to a dBm value (decibels with reference to one milliwatt.)  The Zebra MC3300 has a range of 0-30 dBm so a value of 270 is equivalent to 30 dBM.
Transmit Power
– used when Use Max Transmit Power is disabled and defines transmit power other than the max value.  It is likely that this setting will need to be adjusted for each customer to find the optimal setting.  A lower value (i.e. 30 or 50) makes it easier to scan a specific tag while a higher value allows reading tags from greater distances.
Set Tag Population
– enabled or disabled.
Tag Population
– if Set Tag Population is enabled, this value defines the estimated number of tags that will be in range of the scanner.
Convert IDs to Base 32
– enabled or disabled
If enabled, Id is converted to Base 32 (i.e. 1OG000B706016C1N1R02)
If disabled, Id is Base 16 (i.e. E28068900000000163F009B9)
Use TID Memory Bank
– enables the application to use the value stored in the TID memory bank instead of the default tagId.  Typically ‘Convert IDs to Base 32’ is also selected when this is enabled.
Use EPC Memory Bank
– enables the application to use the value stored in the EPC memory bank instead of the default tagId.  Typically ‘Convert IDs to Base 32’ is also selected when this is enabled.
Login Page
Based on how Login Settings are defined, the login page will appear with various options.
Login page requiring Login Scan but not a Location Scan. User must manually define the Access Location Group and Access Location:
Open image-20210512-193236.png

Airline passengers have been programmed to check-in 24 hours prior to their flights for years now. This allows the airline to capture information on the guest, saves time at the airport, and gives travelers peace of mind that their experience at the airport will be smooth. Aspenware Arrival provides this experience for guests coming to ski and ride at the resort. Guests can check in prior to arriving at the resort.

Resort Tools reduces time spent waiting in line for guests and time spent by resort staff checking guests in across your resort.
Overview
Resort Tools encompasses two products that can be used in one of two ways or in tandem for the optimal onsite guest experience. The two offerings are as follows:
Resort Tools - Kiosk
Resort Tools - Kiosk
is designed for guests to complete the required information at a resort kiosk Our user-facing kiosk is designed to capture required information in your rental stores, pass offices and lesson locations. The streamlined user flow is designed for ease of use and accurate customer profiles. Resorts mitigate risk with the careful completion and collection of required documents.
All guests at a particular location will be guided through the same process, which is optimized for that location. The product can operate without an internet connection if configured for offline use. Guests can use a fast-flow option with pre-filled information, but personalization based on guest data and order details is unavailable. If personalization is important,
Aspenware Arrival
may be a better option. To use Resort Tools - Kiosk, a Resort Tools or Aspenware Arrival license is required.

Resort Tools - Waiver Tablets (Guest Check-In)
Resort Tools - Waiver Tablets (Guest Check-In) enables guests to complete required information onsite. This tool enables the signing of waivers, the ability to email waivers to non-present attendees, the option to opt into marketing communications, and the ability to capture and upload a photo.

Orders Creation in SWEB from RTP Sales Transactions

Ongoing Support and Maintenance
This solution supports the use of the SKIDATA Skiosk to print media from an RTP order or sales transaction.  Sales that contain deferred printable media from RTP are uploaded to SKIDATA’s SWEB tool which can then be printed on the Skiosk.  Once printed, SKIDATA sends the RFID back to RTP and marks the media as printed.  The media can then be used for validation in RTP.
Solution Overview
There are 4 main aspects to this solution.  1) SKIDATA DTA/SWEB, 2) Unity Contractor Service, 3) Unity DTA Jobs, and 4) RTP.
Open image-20230425-162904.png
SKIDATA DTA/SWEB
SKIDATA provides access to SWEB during the implementation and will also provide training on the tool.  Typically SWEB is accessed often during the initial implementation phase to verify interfaced products and orders but then less after go-live.  The interface between Aspenware and SKIDATA only uses a small portion of SWEB which is also used with SKIDATAs POS and parking system.
SKIDTA Skiosks
This is the hardware that prints RFID cards (shown above).
DTA
This is the name of the interface used by a 3rd party system to interact with SKIDATA’s system.
SWEB
SWEB is the name of the user interface used by the SKIDATA Skiosks and can be used to view interfaced products and orders.  The printing template the Skiosks use is also defined in SWEB.
Open image-20230425-181722.png
Unity Contactor Service
The Unity Contractor Service is an Aspenware-created Windows IIS application that is installed locally at the resort. The application is used for for 2 purposes which are to create products in SKIDATA’s SWEB application (via the catalog import function) and to upload the RFID from the Skiosk back into RTP and to mark the media as printed.
An RTP Client Code is defined in the SKIDATA SWEB tool which is used in the catalog import process to lookup products in RTP that are eligible to be printed on the Skoisk.  A product is created in SWEB for each RTP product and a mapping is automatically defined to the RTP product header code.  Only products that are interfaced to SWEB through the catalog import process are then eligible to printed on the Skiosks.  Once printed, SWEB sends the RFID back to the Unity Contractor Service where it is uploaded into RTP’s ExternalAccessMap table and the media is marked as printed in the TransactionProductOutput table.
Unity DTA Jobs
The Unity DTA Jobs service is also an Aspenware-created Windows IIS application that is installed locally at the resort.  This application polls RTP’s TransactionProductOutput table every minute for new records.  Only transactions with products that have previously been interfaced to SKIDATA’s SWEB tool (via the catalog import) will be picked up by the service and sent to SKIDATA to create an order.  An Order is created in SWEB with a reference to the RTP Sales Transaction ID, Order ID or External Order ID which is used to retrieve the order and print (usually from a QR or barcode).
RTP
RTP sales transactions and fulfilled orders that contain deferred media of season pass and access products are eligible to be printed on the Skiosks.  As mentioned previously, the products must first be included in the catalog import process and interfaced to SWEB before a sales transaction or fulfilled order containing deferred media will be created in SWEB as an Order.
RTP Client Code
The RTP Client Code defined in SWEB will be used by the catalog import to lookup which products meet the criteria to be included in the import process.
Products must be priced in RTP for the day the catalog import runs.
An existing RTP Client Code can be used or a new one can be created.  The Sale Location assigned to the Client in RTP can also be an existing sale location or a new one dedicated to a new Skiosk Location.  The benefit of using a new sale location is that products could be priced for all dates.  If products are only priced for part of the year, it is likely multiple catalog imports will need to be performed in order to interface those products to SWEB making transactions and orders that contain these products eligible to be printed on the Skiosks.  If products are available all season, then it is possible only a single catalog import will need to be run at the beginning of the season.
The Client Code will also be uploaded into several RTP tables as the client code that printed the media (i.e. TransactionProductOutput.OutputClientCode).
Detailed Setup Guide
The following instructions detail the setup steps for using the SKIDATA Skiosk to print media from an RTP order or sales transaction.
Set Up SWEB Contractor
Import SWEB Catalog
Configure SWEB Print Mask (Media Template)
Install Aspenware IIS Application
Test UnityDTAJobs Install
Trigger Sending of RTP Transactions to SKIDATA/SWEB
Select Testing Method
Add Rules to Product Header Codes
Go Live
1. Set Up SWEB Contractor
The Unity Contractor Service URL is define in SWEB which is where SKIDATA will configure a Contractor entry. Aspenware will provide the URL to the Unity Contractor Service once it is setup or will add the URL to SWEB.  This can be found in SWEB in Sales Management / Tenants / Contractors.
Following is an example from Aspenware’s test environment.
Edit the Contractor entry and then navigate to the Contractor System tab to define the URL.
Open image-20230425-203416.png
Open image-20230425-203448.png
2. Click ‘Check Connectivity’ to test the connection from SKIDATA’s SWEB tool to the Unity Contractor Service installed locally at the resort.  The URL format is below but will differ for each install =
https://servername.com/UnityContractorService/ContractorService.svc
Open image-20230425-203735.png
Open image-20230502-153641.png
2. Import SWEB Catalog
SKIDATA will configure portions of SWEB prior to the first catalog import.  The catalog import can be found in SWEB in Sales Management > Configuration > Catalogs and there is typically only one entry created for the resort.  The RTP Client Code that will be used to lookup products in RTP is defined in the External ID field (see below).  At least one catalog import will need to be completed prior to any attempt to print from the Skiosks.
Open image-20230425-202054.png
To start the catalog import, click the
Import
button along the top ribbon. Then click
Start Import
.
Open image-20230425-202607.png
2. The import process only takes a few seconds.  To view the products imported, click the Products button along the top ribbon.
Open image-20230425-202713.png
3. If the import was successful, products will show in the list.  Use the gear/settings icon to show the External Id column which shows the RTP Product Header code.
Open image-20230425-202911.png
3. Configure SWEB Print Mask (Media Template)
The catalog import also configures a Print Mask in SWEB which is the media template that prints when a Skiosk order is fulfilled.  This is located in Sales Management > Configuration > Print Masks.  Each time the catalog imports runs, the print mask gets set back to the default which some customers do not use.
It is recommended to define the Print Mask during testing and then to export the template from SWEB and then re-import after each catalog import.
The default template pulls a description from one of the Unity Contractor Service configuration files so this could be used to define a short text line on the template (e.g., Winter 22-23).  Some customers use this and therefore need to remember to update the configuration file after each season.  Each time the configuration file is updated, a catalog import will need to be performed to add the new descriptions to SWEB.  The text is located in the web.config file in the DTA ticketText field.  Additional information can be found on this in the install section of this guide.
Open image-20230425-210309.png
Double click the entry above to edit the template.
Open image-20230425-211351.png
2. To export the template, click
Miscellaneous
in the upper right corner and then the
Export
button.  This will download a JSON file that can be used to import the template using the same method after the next catalog import.
Open image-20230425-211446.png
3. To import, click the
Import Template
button.
Open image-20230425-211609.png
4. Install Aspenware IIS Application
Aspenware will perform 2 installations on Unity in conjunction with this implementation.
Install Unity Contractor Service
Aspenware will install the Unity Contractor Service on a server at the resort that is accessible to the SKIDATA web services.  SKIDATA will provide the IP range of the traffic so that the server can be locked down.  The Unity Contractor Service is an IIS application that is accessed by SKIDATA for the catalog import function and to upload printed RFID’s to RTP.
The following config/json files contain all the configuration values needed for the service.
Rtp-config.json
– contains all RTP configuration values
SalesChannelCode:
Sales channel used for the product catalog import.  Products need to be priced for the day the catalog imports runs and to have output added in RTP for the sales channel defined.
UserID
: This must be a valid user with a valid UserSession.SessionToken in RTP.  This user will be the OperatorID that printed the media in several RTP database tables.
Database Connection string (server, db, SQL user)
: Aspenware will create a new SQL Role and User and the Role needs to have privileges to the following tables.  Aspenware can configure this in SSMS or provide a script.

AuditLocationCod
e: Not used but set to the same location code above.
Web.config
– contains additional setup data
Skiosks:
Defines mapping for SKIDATA Skiosk and RTP Client code.  This client code will be updated in RTP’s TransactionProductOutput.OutputClientCode column as the client that printed the output and shows in various places in RTP.  Currently on a single mapping is supported by SKIDATA.  Define the SKIDATA Sales Channel name to map to the RTP client code in this section.

ticketText:
Text data is imported during catalog import to SWEB/Print Mask, ‘Text Print Mask Item 1’. If text is changed directly in SWEB, data will be overwritten with text defined in web.config in next catalog import.  If this media element is not added to the Print Mask in SWEB, there is no need to update this from season to season.
priceCategoryName:
Text data is imported during catalog import to SWEB/Price Category.  This description does not show during fulfillment but does show in SKIDATA admin.  Typically this description is set to match the same description of ticketText above.
seasonStartDate
&
seasonEndDate:
Dates are imported during catalog import to SWEB/Time Periods.  Aspenware recommends defining a large data range to avoid having to update each season since this data only shows in SKIDATA admin.

Install Unity DTA Jobs
Aspenware will install the Unity DTA Jobs on a server at the resort that is accessible to the SKIDATA DTA web services.  SKIDATA will provide the IP range of the traffic so that the server can be locked down.  The Unity DTA Jobs is an IIS application that is used to look up transactions in RTP that have deferred output and to create orders in SKIDATA’s SWEB application.  Microsoft’s dotnet-hosting will also need to be installed on the server hosting the UnityDTAJobs application.
The UnityDTA Jobs service uses Hangfire which is a 3rd party product used to perform background processing in .NET and .NET Core applications.  Hangfire has several database tables that will also need to be deployed which are described below.
Install UnityDTAJobs database
Aspenware has scripts to install the UnityDTAJobs database which also include database tables for Hangfire.  These tables track which RTP transactions have been sent to SKIDATA/SWEB.  See below for screenshot of the tables included in the UnityDTAJobs database.
Open image-20230509-145344.png
Configure UnityDTAJobs
The following config/json files contain all the configuration values needed for the UnityDTAJobs service.
appsettings.json
Used to define database connection info to the Hangfire database tables.
DBConnString:
Define server and database hosting Hangfire database tables.
SyncReservationsBatchSize:
Defines the batch size for syncing RTP transactions to SWEB.  Default is 100.
SyncReturnsBatchSize:
Defines the batch size for syncing RTP return transactions to SWEB which cancel a previously created order.  Default is 100.
SyncPrintUpdatesBatchSize:
Defines the batch size for syncing print updates.  Default is 100.
EmailSettings:
Used to define SMTP email server info for alerts when an error occurs syncing RTP transactions or cancellations to SKIDATA.
skidata-config.json:
Defines SKIDATA production URL’s for the DTA interface.  Typically these do not change.
Client:
Define the SKIDATA DTA Tenant (from SWEB)
WorkingClientName:
Define the SKIDATA Sales Channel Name (from SWEB)
PointofSaleName:
Define the SKIDATA Sales Channel Name (from SWEB)
User/Password:

5. Test UnityDTAJobs Install
Once installed, navigate to
http://localhost/UnityDTAJobs/hangfire/
in a browser on the machine hosting the application.  If the install was successful, the Hangfire Dashboard should show rather than an error page.  The Realtime Graph below shows the number of transactions processed and the History Graph shows the total uptime of the Hangfire service.
Open image-20230502-183550.png
6. Trigger Sending RTP Transactions to SKIDATA/SWEB
The UnityDTAJobs IIS application uses the dta.LastProcessedTransaction table to track the transactions that have already been sent to SKIDATA.  During the implementation, the ProcessDate will be set to a date in the past and will begin processing once the IIS application is started.  Once the date catches up to the current date, only new transactions containing deferred output will be processed moving forward.
Open image-20230502-184200.png
Every RTP transaction is reviewed by the service to see if there is any deferred output that meets the criteria to be sent to SKIDATA to create an order.  The criteria is that the product in the transaction has been previously interfaced to SKIDATA using the product catalog import and that the product has the Rule, ‘Skidata Print PUB’ added (See rules information below).  Each RTP transaction ID that meets the criteria, will be created in SWEB as an Order and the DTAOrderID will be recorded in the dta.Reservation table.
Open image-20230502-184402.png
The DTAOrderID will also be updated into RTP’s TransactionHeader table in the OfflineTransactionID field.
Open image-20230509-150511.png
Below shows an Order in SWEB created from RTP Transaction ID, 101525809.  If the order originated from an Aspenware online order, the ConfirmationNumber will be the RTP ExternalOrderID (i.e. PK12345).
Open image-20230502-184727.png
7. Select Testing Method
It is possible to point all the services to RTPOneTest to perform testing but it is easier to test against RTPOne prod instead.  The main issue with using RTPOneTest is that SKIDATA does not have a test system so it’s possible that an RTP TransactionID that was interfaced to SKIDATA/SWEB during testing from RTPOneTest will exist in RTPOne production as a real customer’s TransactionID.  The SKIDATA development team can clear out orders that were created during testing but using the method below against RTPOne prod is preferred for testing.
Below is an outline to perform initial testing without interfacing all RTP transactions to SKIDATA SWEB.
Set the dta.LastProcessedTransaction table to have a ProcessDate of today for all rows.
Recycle the UnityDTAJobs application pool (or start the service).
Create or clone an RTP Product Header that contains media output that has never been sold to a customer and add all three Skiosk related Rules (Unity Attribute - Age, Unity Attribute - Duration, and SkiData Print on PUB).
In SKIDATA SWEB, start the product catalog import and verify the new product shows up
If no product, review the SWEB DTA Transaction Logs for any errors.
If no errors in DTA Transaction Logs, review the UnityContractorService log
If no errors in the UnityContractorService log, start SQL trace to see call hitting RTP and manually run in SSMS.  This may reveal that the product does not meet the criteria to be interfaced (pricing, sales channel, sale location, etc).
In RTP, create a sales transaction and sell the product created in step 1 above.  Make sure to defer media during the sale.
In SWEB, make sure you see an Order show up within a minute or two.
If no order in SWEB, verify the UnityDTAJobs IIS application is running (verify the application pool is started).
If UnityDTAJobs is running, check error log.
If no errors, verify there is deferred output in RTP’s Deferred Output Tool.
Check the UnityDTAJobs table, dta.Reservation for the most recent entries to see if there are errors.
Create a barcode or QR code of the RTP TransactionID and attempt to use at Skiosk.
If nothing prints, re-verify the Transactions is in SWEB as an Order
If Order exists but nothing prints, ask SKIDATA to check the Skiosk log (which is located directly on the PC inside the Skiosk hardware.
If media prints, verify the RFID can be used to perform a search in RTP.
If RFID cannot be searched successfully in RTP, look for errors in the UnityContractorService log.
Repeat steps above for an RTP OrderID that is manually created and fulfilled in RTP and for an online order.
For an Order created directly in RTP, use the RTP OrderID as the barcode/QR code at the Skiosk.
For an online order, use the RTP ExternalOrderID as the barcode/QR code at the Skiosk.
8. Add Rules to Product Header Code(s)
Three Product Header Rules need to be added to any product that will be printed from the Skiosk.
IMPORTANT
:
DO NOT ADD THESE RULES UNTIL GO-LIVE.
More info on this can be found in the testing section of this document below.
Rule 1: Unity Attribute - Duration
Add Duration rule to Product Header Codes per the diagram and define a value of 1.
Open image-20230613-212505.png
Duration Rule
Rule 2: Unity Attribute - Age
Add Age rule to Product Header Codes per the diagram and define a value of 1.
Open image-20230613-212816.png
Age Rule
Rule 3: SkiData Print on PUB
Add SkiData Print on PUB Rule to Product Header Codes and define a value of TRUE.
Open image-20230613-213139.png
SKIDATA Print on PUB Rule
Open image-20230425-182209.png
Example of Rules added to PHC
Configure Product components to have Output and to Allow Deferral.
NOTE
: If after go-live, the resort realizes they did not add the three Rules to all products, the catalog import can be run again and the ProcessDate in the dta.LastProcessedTransaction can be set back to a date in the past.  The service will run and skip over any transaction it has already processed and only create orders in SWEB for transactions containing the new products.  This process will also take a few hours because every transaction is reviewed again by the service.
9. Go Live
Going live with the Skiosks means ensuring all products in RTP have the three rules added and then setting the ProcessDate in the dta.LastProcessedTransaction to a date in the past.  If the testing method above was followed, there should be no need to clear out data in the dta.Reservation table.
Stop the UnityDTAJobs application pool.
Ensure the 3 product header rules have been added to all products.
(SEE SECTION ABOVE)
Start the product catalog import in SWEB
Ask the resort to review the list of products.  If products are missing, ask the resort to add the three Rules to additional products and/or verify the product(s) are priced for ‘today'.
Repeat this step until the resort verifies all products are showing in SWEB.
Set the dta.LastProcessedTransaction table to have a ProcessDate in the past.  This should be the date of or right before the date they started selling media products for the season.
Start the UnityDTAJobs application pool.
Verify Orders are showing in SKIDATA SWEB.  This process can take a few hours depending on how far back the date goes and how many total transaction's the resort has.
To verify the initial load of Orders is complete, verify the ProcessDate for the Reservation column now shows today’s date.
Orders Creation in SWEB from RTP Sales Transactions
The Unity DTA Service is always running in the customer’s environment and is looking for new RTP transactions that contain deferred pass media and access output.  The products in these transactions need to have the Product Header Rule, SkiData Print On PUB and the products must currently be in SWEB from a catalog import.  If all these conditions are met, an Order gets created in SWEB which can be viewed in Sales Management > Monitoring > Orders (see below).  Once the Order is created in SWEB, it can then be printed from the Skiosk.
If an order or is cancelled in RTP or the fulfillment transactions has been returned, the order is then cancelled in SKIDATA/SWEB and cannot be printed.
The ‘Confirmation Number’ that appears in SWEB will be the RTP Sales Transaction ID if the deferred output is associated with an RTP sales transaction (completed directly in RTP), an RTP OrderID if the deferred output originated from an RTP order (completed directly in  RTP), or the ExternalOrderID if the sale originated from an Aspenware order (or any 3rd party processing orders into RTP).
This is the only value mapped to the SKIDATA Order and is the only value that can be used to find and print the order on the Skiosk.
In other words, for an Aspenware order, only the ExternalOrderID will get mapped to the Order in SWEB so only that value can be used to find the order and print the media from the Skiosk.  The RTP OrderID from Aspenware’s order cannot be used to find the order in SWEB.
Open image-20230425-223635.png
Ongoing Support and Maintenance
Depending on the products being printed on the Skiosks, additional product catalog imports may need to be run in the future.  Some resorts have very few products that haven’t changed from year to year so they may have only used the catalog import function during the initial implementation.  Resorts that are not bundling media with access on product headers may have very few media product headers and therefore very few interfaced products in SKIDATA/SWEB.  Resorts that bundle media and access may have dozens or hundreds of products interfaced to SKIDATA/SWEB.
The key thing to remember is that ‘todays’ date is used when the catalog import runs so if a resort does not have pricing setup until their opening date (i.e. 11/15/2024), then running the catalog import in October will not interface products to SKIDATA/SWEB.
As mentioned above, each time the catalog import is run in SWEB, the Print Mask resets back to the default so if the resort isn’t using the default, they will need to import the Print Mask file after each import.

The Aspenware Scanning application integrates into RTP’s access control system and can be used to process online and offline scans.  The application runs on handheld devices running Android kitkat up to version 11 of Android  (version 4.4 to version 11) which also have the DataWedge application (typically Zebra devices).  The devices connect via http or https to a server within the resorts internal local area network (LAN) running Aspenware’s Unity API.  Unity then communicates to the RTP database on the resorts LAN to verify scanning data and retrieve customer information.  The Unity API can be installed on the existing RTP application server or on another server located within the resort’s LAN.
The devices should be configured on the resorts local area network (LAN) and not a through a public wireless access point.  The devices should not have access to the internet, and it is the resorts responsibility to secure access to the scanner data and network traffic.  It is also recommended to disable Bluetooth and any cellular networks on the device.
There are 3 main aspects of this solution, 1) Android Device (AWScanning.apk), 2) Unity, and 3) RTP

Web Service
– defines connectivity information for the device to connect to Unity.
Device
– defines DeviceID as well as behavior of the Login page.  See below for more info on each setting.
Sound Settings
– defines sound and vibration settings for offline, validate only and live  scans.  See below for more info on sound settings.
UHF Scan Settings
– only displays on a device that is configured to use UHF.  These settings control the default trigger mode, range of the UHF reader and RFID conversion type.  See below for more info on each setting.

Device ID
– defines the ID used to record scans in RTP.  Recommend defining a unique Device ID per device.
Require Location Scan
– determines whether user can manually select Access Location or if scanning a barcode is required to sign-in.  If set to Y, user must scan a valid AccessLocationCode from RTP (i.e barcode of 100, 110, 120, etc.)
Validate UserID
– determines whether username is a validated against RTP.  If enabled, a valid RTP UserID must be used to sign-in.
Force Login Scan
– determines whether a user must scan a pass media barcode or read an RFID card to sign-in.  If enabled, the RTP IPCode the pass belongs to must be added to a UserID in Admin/Security Administration/User in RTP:
Open image-20210512-192321.png
Enable Add Customer ID
–enables functionality to allow operator to enter an RTP Customer ID (IPCode) when a certain RTP Access Error is returned as a scan result.  After entering customer ID, a new scan will be triggered that appends the {CustomerID} to the end of the previously scanned code.
Customer ID Scan Code –
click to enter a specific RTP Access Error ‘Error Message’ for the Enable Add Customer ID functionality.  This will be the only RTP Access Error that will trigger this functionality to allow an operator to enter a Customer ID (IPCode).  For example, ‘Bad Type’ is entered below so when this scan result is returned to the scanner, the ‘Add Customer ID’ option will display allowing the operator to enter an RTP IPCode.
Open image-20210512-192356.png
After scan occurs that returns this type, the Add Customer ID button appears:
Open image-20210512-192410.png
Which allows the operator to enter data which then gets appended to the previously scanned code and triggers a new scan:

Settings - Sound Settings
Sound settings define the sound generated for an Offline, Validate Only and Live Scan on the device.  Several sounds are delivered in each category and custom sounds can also be uploaded as of v1.14 of the app.  You can also define whether the device vibrates with each type of sound by checking the Vibrate checkbox.
For Live Scans, ‘Beep’ settings are used to map to valid and invalid scans from RTP Access Rule Product Type administration.  Settings for 1 and 3 Beeps are delivered with the device and map to a valid and invalid scan from RTP (3 is always an invalid scan in RTP).  Additional Beeps can be added which map to RTP’s Access Rule Product Type administration entries.  To add new Beeps, click the ‘New Setting’ button below and define an un-used Beep Count, Sound and Vibrate setting.  ‘4 Beeps’ has been added in the screen shot below.  After adding a new setting, you must click the ‘Save Settings’ button.
Open image-20210512-192832.png
To upload custom sounds
, place a .wav file in the devices Notification directory and select the custom sound file when defining new beeps or when editing the Offline and/or Validate Only settings.  For example, in the screen shots below, the ‘LightningSound.wav’ was uploaded to the device making it available to select through the app.

Settings - UHF Scan Settings
The UHF Scan Settings are configurable to allow adjusting the default behavior of the trigger, the transmit power of the device as well as the type of RFID’s populated into the device.
Open image-20230118-223307.png
Open image-20230118-223228.png
Trigger Mode
Barcode and RFID – allows the scanner to scan barcodes and read RFID tags.  When this is enabled, a barcode will be read first even if an RFID tag is in range.
RFID Only – only allows the scanner to scan RFID tags.
Use Max Transmit Power
– impacts the range of the scanner.  When enabled, the max range of the device will be used to scan RFID tags.  The max range for the Zebra MC3300 is 270 but this can differ per device.  This value is a numeric value that relates to a dBm value (decibels with reference to one milliwatt.)  The Zebra MC3300 has a range of 0-30 dBm so a value of 270 is equivalent to 30 dBM.
Transmit Power
– used when Use Max Transmit Power is disabled and defines transmit power other than the max value.  It is likely that this setting will need to be adjusted for each customer to find the optimal setting.  A lower value (i.e. 30 or 50) makes it easier to scan a specific tag while a higher value allows reading tags from greater distances.
Set Tag Population
– enabled or disabled.
Tag Population
– if Set Tag Population is enabled, this value defines the estimated number of tags that will be in range of the scanner.
Convert IDs to Base 32
– enabled or disabled
If enabled, Id is converted to Base 32 (i.e. 1OG000B706016C1N1R02)
If disabled, Id is Base 16 (i.e. E28068900000000163F009B9)
Use TID Memory Bank
– enables the application to use the value stored in the TID memory bank instead of the default tagId.  Typically ‘Convert IDs to Base 32’ is also selected when this is enabled.
Use EPC Memory Bank
– enables the application to use the value stored in the EPC memory bank instead of the default tagId.  Typically ‘Convert IDs to Base 32’ is also selected when this is enabled.
Login Page
Based on how Login Settings are defined, the login page will appear with various options.
Login page requiring Login Scan but not a Location Scan. User must manually define the Access Location Group and Access Location:

Airline passengers have been programmed to check-in 24 hours prior to their flights for years now. This allows the airline to capture information on the guest, saves time at the airport, and gives travelers peace of mind that their experience at the airport will be smooth. Aspenware Arrival provides this experience for guests coming to ski and ride at the resort. Guests can check in prior to arriving at the resort.

Description
Airline passengers have been programmed to check-in 24 hours prior to their flights for years now. This allows the airline to capture information on the guest, saves time at the airport, and gives travelers peace of mind that their experience at the airport will be smooth. Aspenware Arrival provides this experience for guests coming to ski and ride at the resort. Guests can check in prior to arriving at the resort.
Guests interacting with Arrival will use the application to complete missing information or tasks required for their upcoming activities. For example:
If they have already purchased their resort products, but are missing required information, they may receive an email with a link to Arrival. These are most often automatically triggered to send 1-2 days prior to the guest’s activity via a CRM, based on the guest having an upcoming activity purchase that requires an Arrival task to be completed.
If they are purchasing on-premise and need to fill out information prior to checking out at a cashier, they may navigate to a Location URL (“Non-transaction driven” URL) from a QR code posted in the rental shop or pass office.
If they want to get easy access to the QR codes to print their non-printed media at a Pick Up Box at the resort, they may be prompted to download their unique QR codes to their Apple wallet from Arrival before their trip via a triggered email, or they might scan a QR code posted near the PUBs to be directed to get their unique QR code for printing in Arrival.
If they want to check to confirm whether their pass is ready to take direct to lift, they may go to pass checker via a link from the  a “make sure you’re prepared for your upcoming trip” email sent to them by the resort to validate that they have the right media on hand and access products purchased before they arrive.
Pass Media Redemption
QR codes will be displayed in Arrival for guests to use to pick up media at either an Axess PUB or Skidata Skiosk. For easy access, guests can also add these QR codes to various apps such as Apple Wallet and GPay.
Open image-20210618-161649.png
Pass Checker
On Arrival’s Pass Checker page, guests can look up their pass eligibility by either Pass# or RFID#. They can also filter between specific lifts and date combinations to check their pass eligibility. This is useful for resorts that limit lift access for specific gates and also for passes that have blackout dates.

How it works
Arrival uses Locations, Activities, and Tasks to determine what functions guests will be completing.
Locations
- A Resort can have several Locations. Each Location will have its own unique URL to which guests can navigate. Each Location requires a default activity. Examples of locations include:
“
POS Transactions
” - A “
POS Transactions
” Location might prompt users to complete tasks personalized to them based off of orders placed in your POS system. Whether through an eCommerce store such as Aspenware Commerce or placed directly into the POS through a phone call or resort visit.
“
Rental Shop”
A “
Rental Shop
” Location is most likely a configuration used for purchases made by guests who are physically at a rental location on-premise.
Activities
- An Activity is comprised of one or more tasks. These task may be related to a specific purchase. Examples include:
“
Purchases
” - This might be an Activity underneath the “
POS Transactions”
Location. This particular Activity will link to specific tasks that are required to be completed by the guest for the particular product purchases they have where they are missing required information.  The guest would only be prompted to fill out specific tasks that they are personally missing based on their orders.
“
Ski/Snowboard Rentals” -
This might be an Activity underneath the “
Rental Shop
” Location. Again, this particular Activity will link to specific tasks that are required to be completed by the guest for this particular product purchase.
Task
- A Task is the specific function that guests will be completing. Tasks supported in Arrival include:
Waiver Signing
Child Registration Capture
Rental Profile Capture
Photo Capture

Prerequisite Tasks
This section describes all requirements that must be completed before you can begin setting up this feature. Once these tasks are complete continue to the next section.
General Tasks
Determine Arrival Strategy
Work with your Aspenware Representative to determine how Arrival will best be structured to meet the needs of your resort. Consider the following components.
Locations Overview
Locations are used to determine which activities guests will be completing. All Arrival implementations must include
ONE
default location, which is the Location used when navigating directly to your Arrival URL (e.g. http://arrival.yourresort.com/home ). Other (non-default) Locations are accessed by navigating to directories within your Resort’s Arrival URL (e.g. http://arrival.yourresort.com/mss-youth ).
When configuring a location, there are two inherent flows that will be configured at the Location level, transaction and location-driven options.
Transaction-Driven Configuration
- Using the transaction-based configuration, you can proactively reach out to guests with upcoming itineraries, prompting them to check-in in advance with tasks they are missing. Guests will complete tasks specific to what they have ordered through purchases made through your Aspenware Commerce store, the call center, your lodging eCommerce, etc. For example, a family that pre-purchased Season Passes online that has not yet signed waivers would be emailed a link to Arrival prior to their trip. They can sign in, and upon entering Arrival, their orders are recognized and they are prompted with relevant tasks.
Location-Driven Configuration
- The second configuration option is to catch guests who are purchasing onsite or who didn’t complete the required information prior to arrival, prompting them to fill in the required profiles and waivers onsite and on their personal devices. Different Locations can have different configurations and tasks depending on the activities offered at that location, (e.g., ski school, rental shop, etc.). For this flow, resorts can post QR codes around the resort linking to the location’s Arrival link. All guests who pull up these Arrival Location links on their devices will fill out the information that is specific to the Location where the guest is physically located. While some steps may be expedited if a guest has a completed profile or waiver on their account, the steps delivered to the guests through these location-driven flows are not catered to steps for orders on their profile, but rather steps required for that Location.
Prior to Arrival setup, determine how the resort will be using Locations. Some questions to answer include:
How many Locations will you have? Remember a Location doesn’t have to be a physical location - for example, your transaction-driven flows could all be linked to a “purchases” location.
Which Locations will be transaction vs location-driven?
For location-driven setup, determine which steps will be offered and which steps will be required.
Which guest types will you need to “follow up with” prior to their arrival on site or prior to fulfilling their product? Questions to consider include:
Do you need photos and or waivers to be updated prior to printing season passes? Use Arrival to capture photos of guests or obtain signatures for waivers.
Which of your booking systems can’t capture waivers, child registration, rental profiles, and photo? Consider how Arrival can be set up to capture this data prior to these guests' arrival. (e.g., Lodging guests that need to fill out waivers for their package ski products.)
Are there steps you can remove from online check-out flows in favor of capturing this information in a pre-arrival flow instead? Making checkout faster and easier helps conversion rates.
Do you want guests to “review” data they entered prior to their arrival? (e.g., Do they need to confirm their rental profile or child registration profile?)
How far in advance of the product date do you want to follow up with guests to complete arrival information?
What will be your default location? Although not required, Aspenware highly recommends your default location be set up with the transaction-driven configuration.
Activities Overview
Once a determination has been made about what the configurations will be and which Locations will be set up for Arrival, map activities to locations. For transaction-driven flows, create a single activity configured with many tasks and map it to the online location (i.e. POS Transactions Location). In this flow, tasks associated with that Activity will only be triggered if the guest has an order that requires those tasks to be completed or confirmed AND they are missing the information on their profile or a member of their household’s profile.
Tasks Overview
As part of determining Arrival configurations, your Aspenware Representative will work with you to define how the following tasks will be folded into your Arrival Strategy and mapped to your various Locations and Activities.
Photo Upload
Child Registration Profile
Rental Profile
Waivers
POS Tasks
Arrival was developed to determine which tasks a guest needs to complete based on standard
RTP|One
product component configuration. Aspenware developed a custom order and transaction query that searches
RTP|One
for upcoming orders and transactions associated with the guest's
RTP|One
customer record. Outstanding tasks that still need to be completed will be eligible for completion in Arrival. However, the guest can only complete these tasks if they navigate to an Arrival location that also has the task configured. See
Detailed Setup
below for detailed steps to configure this in Arrival Admin. Work with your Aspenware Representative in order to install these four custom stored procedures in your
RTP|One
and
RTP|One
TEST databases. The following stored procedures must be created in both Test and Production databases to query orders and transactions and enable Arrival reporting to function:
AW_proc_publicGetArrivalsChildRegistrationValidationByIPCode
AW_proc_publicGetArrivalsImageAndPrintableMediaByIPCode
AW_proc_publicGetArrivalsRentalProfileValidationByIPCode
AW_proc_publicGetCustomerAuthorizationValidationByIPCode
When determining which products will be utilizing Arrival, review your
RTP|One
waiver and product configuration.
Ensure your fulfillment business rules align with the state the Arrival API expects orders to be in to drive various behavior.
For orders to be in a state where they can be “checked-in” (i.e. to have guests complete waivers and profiles), they should be open order lines or transaction lines. Posted, canceled, and returned order lines will be omitted.
For orders to be in a state where they can be “picked up” (i.e. a QR code is provided for printing access products), items must be auto-fulfilled or a transaction. Open order lines cannot be printed on either device (Ski Data or Axess PUBs).
Ensure waivers are added to product components. Record the waiver ID and work with your Aspenware Representative to add it to the planning document.
IMPORTANT
: Waiver dates across Commerce, Arrival, and
RTP|One
waiver configuration
MUST
align perfectly to avoid discrepancies around who is in the email export and who has tasks loaded in Arrival. If a guest is emailed that they have tasks to complete, they should also have tasks loaded in Arrival, so this alignment is imperative. The waiver expiration date in Commerce,
RTP|One
, and Arrival need to match, and then the validation date in Arrival and on
RTP|One
waiver setup also needs to match.
If they do not match, it could result in people being emailed that they have a waiver to complete in Arrival when it has actually already been completed. For example, if people who bought their season pass online have signed a waiver set to expire 6/15/22 (the expiration date for the season pass waiver in Commerce), but the Arrival report export calls the validation date on the Waiver configuration for to season pass waiver in
RTP|One
that is set to 10/31/22, everyone who had a waiver signed in the pass purchase flow in Commerce this year valid through 6/15/22 would be returned in the Arrival export showing as needing a signed waiver.
Alignment is imperative
.
Ensure a “Pickup on PUB” rule is created in
RTP|One
to allow media to print at PUBs. Ensure the “Pickup on PUB” rule is added to PHCs in
RTP|One
for which media can be printed at the PUB using the QR code presented in Arrival. See
Configuration: Pickup Boxes (PUBS)
for more information.
Determine if you will require a photo for printing pass media.
The customer
must
have active, unprinted pass media.
Note: Potentially a proc update could remove the unprinted requirement but a request to your Aspenware representative would need to be submitted.
If photo
is
required before a guest can print their media, ensure pass media components OR product component rules are configured with the required image setting when needed.
If photo
is not
required before a guest can print their media, then opt to use the rule on the product component rather than pass media rule. To configure this, you can make a product component rule in
RTP|One
admin where the rule name and keyword is "
IMAGEREQUIRED
" and add that to components where you want to require a photo when they're sold to the guest. This is used if you want to require a photo on a component that is not a pass media component, while on a pass media component you can just check the "Image Required" box.
REQUIRED:
Either the rule “
IMAGEREQUIRED
“ must be set on the component being purchased or the pass media component must have the Image Required setting checked in RTP. Additionally, the customer
must
have active, unprinted pass media. Note, that potentially a proc update could remove the unprinted requirement but a request to your Aspenware representative would need to be submitted.
Ensure your product components require a Rental profile when needed. Aspenware requires that
RTP|One
configuration setup has a product component rule in
RTP|One
admin where the rule name and keyword is "
RENTALPROFILEREQUIRED
".
Ensure your product components require a Child Registration profile when needed. Aspenware requires that
RTP|One
configuration setup has a product component rule in
RTP|One
admin where the rule name and keyword is "
CHILDREGPROFILEREQUIRED
".
Infrastructure Tasks
Work with your Aspenware Representative to implement Identity and to create the Azure application services required for Arrival.
Detailed Arrival Setup Guide
The following steps will need to be completed in Arrival Administration. To access Arrival Administration, simply go to <arrival.yourresort.com>/admin. If you do not have Admin access, contact your Aspenware Representative at
support@aspenware.com
to be set up as an admin.
Set Up Task Type
Set Up Tasks

1. Set Up Task Type
Arrival comes pre-configured with task types. However, you can determine the validity duration for each of the task types (child registration, rental profile, and photo upload) You can configure how new (based on UpdateDate in
RTP|One
) a profile must be in order for Arrival to recognize that the task has already been completed.
Navigate to
Arrival Admin > Task Types.
Select the task you’d like to update.
Enter the
Effective Days
value. Configure this setting for Rental Profile, Child Registration Profile, and for Photo. If you set “Rental Profile” to 365 days for example, a guest will not have to complete a rental profile if they already have one that is less than 365 days old. But they will be given the option to update their profile if they wish.
Open image-20201026-141435.png
NOTE
: The
Effective Days
setting is currently only used for
Rental Profile
,
Child Registrastion Profile
, and
Photo
tasks. This setting is not used for the waiver task type and should not be configured. Logic for whether a waiver shows to a guest within Arrival uses effective and expiration dates of Authorization profiles on the guest’s profile and the validation date (more details below on this setting below) to key off whether a waiver is required.
2. Set Up Tasks
Start by configuring Tasks which will later be mapped to Activities. Activities will then be mapped to Locations.
Navigate to the
Tasks
tab in Arrival Admin.
To create a new task, do not check any of the existing tasks in the list and configure a new task by adding the following fields in the
Add New Task
area:
Name:
This is the task name that will display to guests on the site.
Minimum Age:
Optionally limit guests who should be prompted to complete this task based on their age. This defines the youngest age a guest could be to be prompted to complete this task if configured.
Maximum Age:
Optionally limit guests who should be prompted to complete this task based on their age. This defines the oldest age a guest could be to be prompted to complete this task if configured.
Is Optional
: Toggle FALSE to make this task required. For example, in an online location using the transaction-driven flow, you may want to set a task to optional since all guests may not be present when the head of household is checking in. For a physical location using the location-driven flow, you may want to set a task to required since all guests will need to complete the task prior to starting their activity.
Task Type
: Choose from the four available task types (Waiver, Rental Profile, Photo, Child Registration)
If
Task Type= Waiver
, enter the following:
POS Waiver ID:
Enter the corresponding authorization code from
RTP|One
.
External Waiver ID
: This field is for
1Risk
waivers only. See
1Risk Waivers for Arrival
for more information about this feature.
If not using a
1Risk
waiver, leave the field blank.
If using a
1Risk
waiver, input the 1RiskID of the waiver provided by
1Risk.
Select to Consolidate Waiver:
If activated, each required waiver will show in a consolidated view, so the logged-in user will be able to sign all waivers for all members in their family that require
that specific
waiver at one time.  If there are any waivers that are not eligible for consolidation, those waivers will be presented for each member to sign separately.
One Day Waiver:
If toggled on, this setting will always use the current date to determine validity. Arrival will check
RTP|One
for a corresponding authorization record. If one exists, Arrival will check if today’s date falls between the start and expiration dates of the waiver for that customer for that waiver in
RTP|One
. This setting should be used if the
RTP|One
product sets
RTP
waivers to be the product date as the start and expiration dates. This is a way to require a new waiver be signed for each product date. If used, the validation date setup should match
RTP|One
authorization setup for the corresponding waiver.
If outside of the date range, Arrival will determine the guest does not have a valid waiver and will prompt the guest to sign a new waiver.
If inside the date range, Arrival will determine the guest does have a valid waiver, and will not prompt the guest to sign a new waiver.
IMPORTANT
: Ensure there is not a mismatch of Validation Date configuration across Arrival and
RTP|One
Authorization configuration. A mismatch could result in guests being emailed that they have a waiver to complete that they have already signed or vice versa.
Effective Date:
This sets the start effective date for the waiver in
RTP|One
. The date the signed waiver is effective.
IMPORTANT
: Ensure there is not a mismatch of Start Effective Date configuration across Arrival,
RTP|One
Authorization configuration, and Commerce waiver configuration.
Expiration Date:
This sets the expiration date for the waiver in
RTP|One
. The date the signed waiver is effective until.
IMPORTANT
: Ensure there is not a mismatch of Expiration Date configuration across Arrival,
RTP|One
Authorization configuration, and Commerce waiver configuration.
Validation Date
:  This date is used to determine validity.
Arrival will check
RTP|One
for a corresponding authorization record. If one exists, Arrival will check if the Validation date set in Arrival falls between the start and expiration dates of the waiver for that customer for that waiver in
RTP|One
.
If outside of the date range, Arrival will determine the guest does not have a valid waiver and prompt the guest to sign a new waiver.
If inside the date range, Arrival will determine the guest does have a valid waiver, and will not prompt the guest to sign a new waiver.
This field should be left blank if you toggle “One Day Waiver” on.
Often resorts will set the validation date as the same as the "expiration date" for season-long waivers.
IMPORTANT
: Ensure there is not a mismatch of Validation Date configuration across Arrival and RTP|One Authorization configuration. A mismatch could result in guests being emailed that they have a waiver to complete that they have already signed or vice versa. The arrival export, determines the list of guests to email that has unsigned waivers to complete keys off the validation date set up on the waiver in
RTP|One
, while Arrival determines whether a waiver task is needed for a guest once they login to Arrival based on the validation date configured on the waiver task in Arrival.
Signer validation:
At least one of the following must be configured, but can more than one or all can be set.
Enable Agree Checkbox
: If checked, the guest will need to check to agree to the waiver, and will be stored in
RTP|One
that the guest checked to agree to the waiver.
Enable Text Signature:
If checked, the guest will need to type the name of the signed-in user, and it will be stored in
RTP|One
that the guest typed X name to agree to the waiver.
Enable Wet Signature:
If checked, the guest can “ink” their signature, and the image of the signature will be stored in
RTP|One
.
NOTE: This option requires RTP2016 or later.
Custom Comment:
This field gives the option to populate the comment box in
RTP|One
’s Authorization profile. Can be used with tokens {Signer}, {SignedDate}, {BrowserName}, {BrowserVersion} to provide who signed, on what date, with what browser, and what browser version.
For waivers, the exact HTML that a guest sees through Arrival will be saved in the profile text in the authorization record in RTP|One.
Select
UPDATE TASK
when complete.

3. Set Up Activities
Once Tasks are set up, Activities are used to assign one or more Tasks to an Activity.
Create a New Activity
Navigate to the
Activities
tab in Arrival Admin.
To create a new activity, do not check any of the existing Activities in the list and configure a new activity by adding the following fields in the
Add New Activity
area:
Name
: The name input here will be displayed to guests so they know which activity they are completing.
Age Min
: (Optional) Adding a minimum age restricts which guests can be selected to check in for this specific Activity. If a guest is younger than the specified age, then they cannot be selected on the Activity page and will be unable to complete any Tasks associated with the Activity.
Age Max
: (Optional) Adding a maximum age restricts which guests can be selected to check in for this specific Activity. If a guest is older than the specified age, then they cannot be selected on the Activity page and will be unable to complete any Tasks associated with the Activity.
Image Url
: The URL for the image that will appear on the Activity page in conjunction with the Activity. Recommended dimensions are at least
1400x900
but must be under
270KB
in file size.
Click the ADD ACTIVITY and scroll up to the
Activity List
to find the newly created Activity to edit/add Tasks.
Open image-20201020-192357.png
Add Tasks to a New Activity
Go to the
Activities
tab in Arrival Admin.
In the
Activities List
section, click the checkbox next to the desired Activity
.
Scroll down to the
Link Tasks
section.
Choose a Task
:
Click here and select a Task to add to this Activity.
Click
LINK TASK
to add the selected task to the Activity.
Multiple tasks can be added via the steps above, or a task can be removed here by clicking the red trash can icon next to the task.
IMPORTANT
: If you are creating an activity that will be added to a transaction-based location, ensure that all the tasks you would like to prompt guests to complete in Arrival based on their transactions are added to the Activity. Though there may be many tasks configured within the activity, guests going through the transaction-based flow would only be prompted to fill out specific tasks that they are personally missing based on their orders in
RTP|One
.
Open image-20201020-192641.png
4. Set Up Location(s)
Once you have completed Task and Activity configuration, you are ready to configure Locations.
Go to the
Locations
tab in Arrival Admin.
To create a new location, do not check any of the existing locations in the list and configure a new location by adding the following fields in the
Add New Location
area:
Location Name:
This name will display to guests on the site. This name will also be included in the directory within the URL. A '-' will substitute any space in the location name. (e.g. If the location name is Ski School the url will be
http://arrival.yourresort.com/ski-school
)
Description:
This is
used for internal organization. This description will not display to guests.
Is Enabled
: This is equivalent to “publishing” the location. When selected, guests will be able to navigate to the Location URL.
Is Default:
When selected, this location will be your default location.
IMPORTANT
: Only one Location can be configured as the default Location. This is the location that will be loaded for /home.
Is Edit Profile Location:
When this is selected, this Location will be your “Edit Profile” location. This Location is designed to allow guests to update tasks they have already completed. For example, you can configure rental profiles and child registration tasks at this Location to allow guests to update these profiles even after they have valid profiles. Guests will have the option to navigate to this “Edit Profile” Location after completing check-in from a Location using the POS transaction-driven configuration.
NOTE
: This configuration is optional for your resort. A max of one Location can be configured as the Edit Profile location.
On the POS location URL, the edit profile button will only appear once all “POS” tasks displayed have been completed for all family members.
Use POS Transactions (RTP):
When this is selected, this Location will function based on
RTP|One
orders and transactions, driving tasks off of incomplete steps for orders for the household in
RTP|One
. If unselected, this Location will follow the location-driven configuration outlined in the
Locations Overview
section of this document above.
Check in Complete Text:
This is the messaging the guest will see once the guest has completed all required steps for this Location.
NOTE:
HTML is supported, but should be limited to the standard text where possible (H1, H2, H3, P, UL, LI). While image tags are supported, special precautions should be taken to avoid breaking the responsive nature of the site across devices.
Default Activity:
The default activity is the activity used to create check-in tasks for this particular Location. For a POS transaction location, only tasks that are added to this default activity will be presented to the user, even if
RTP|One
is indicating that additional info is required. For example: If
RTP|One
is indicating that the guest requires waiver #999 but that waiver is not created as a task and assigned to the default activity, the user will not be asked to sign the waiver in Arrival.
POS Transaction (transaction-driven) Location: Only the default activity is used for check-in at this time. In a future version, additional linked activities can be used to generate tasks and the order of assigned activities does not matter. Regardless, one must be selected as default for Arrival to function properly.
Non-POS (location-driven) Location: Only the default activity is used for check-in at this time. All other linked activities are ignored. In the future, all Locations will offer guests the ability to check in for one or more activities.
Assign Activities:
The default activity must also be assigned to the Location.
Select your Location and in the column on the right, select the drop-down under
Link Activities
.
Select the Activity to assign to the Location.
Click
LINK ACTIVITY
.
Future versions of Arrival will support multiple Activities per location.
Once complete, select
UPDATE LOCATION
.

8. Update Arrival Settings
Go to the
General Tab
to set up Arrival site-wide settings. The following can be edited:
Display External Order ID as QR Code:
This is used to display a QR code to the guest on the home page of any POS transaction location.
Deselecting this will set the
RTP|One
IP code as the QR code.
Selecting this will set the QR code on the arrival screen to the External Order ID. Presently this is required for resorts using
SkiData for Skiosk PUBs.
NOTE
: Guests who did not purchase through the online sales channel will not have a QR code to display as one does not exist.
Google analytics tag id:
Input your GTM code here to track Arrival actions via GA. The ID must start with "GTM". While this GTM ID does need to be updated, you will also need to configure your Google Tag Manager environment to match the documented guidelines for how to set up tags, triggers, and variables to actually track data.
Login - Aspenware Customer Hub
Resort codes:
Optional. This can be entered to filter Arrival’s order/transaction search in
RTP|One
. This can be useful if
RTP|One
is shared amongst several resorts or if there is a need to filter out specific orders/transactions. The Value input is the
RTP|One
’s Business Unit (resort) settings.
Resort group codes
:
Optional for the same uses as resort codes. The Value input is
RTP|One
's Business Group.
Sales locations ids
:
Optional for the same uses as resort codes. The Value input is
RTP|One
's Location ID.
Pass Check POS Location Id
: Refer to the
Login - Aspenware Customer Hub
for details on configuring Pass Checker in Arrival. This setting serves as a default lift or access point that passes will be validated against in the instance that additional “accesslocations” are not defined within the “Collections” admin area.
8. Configure Export List of Eligible Customers for Email (Optional)
Arrival offers the ability to generate a list of customers that are eligible to check-in on Arrival. This is designed to be able to be generated once daily at a planned time and can be used to generate email lists for external email and CRM systems to send notifications to guests, either via manual list uploads or through our API integration if your CRM supports the Arrival API integration.
NOTE
: Aspenware will not be providing the capability to actually send these emails.
Generally, the overnight export will use the same logic as the Order and Transaction API described in the
POS Tasks
section above. If the guest has tasks to complete in Arrival, they will appear on this list. The API will provide a file of all the guests who have items to check in and/or media to print. This file will be generated on a schedule overnight so as to reduce processing overhead when the API itself is called.
The core API parameters will be
Days Before
and
Days After
and an array of sale location codes (no IPCodes).
If the
Days After
is set to 5, meaning that guests should be checked in for products with a start date (product) up to 5 days in the future, this means they will appear on the export 5 days prior to their start date.
If a guest does not complete their arrival tasks 5 days prior to the start date, they will also appear on the export 4 days prior, 3 days prior, etc. until their tasks are completed. It will be up to the CRM/Email system to prevent sending emails to the same guest too often.
IMPORTANT
: A guest with a non-date based product will be returned in the export if
RTP|One
needs that task completed and the Arrival POS Location has a matching task.
Because the list is pre-processed, any changes in the list that happen after it is generated will not be accounted for throughout the day. For example, if the file is generated at 5am and emails are sent out at 5:30am, it is possible that a guest’s tasks to complete or media to pick up may have changed either due to them completing those tasks or something changing in
RTP|One
like a transaction being returned.
NOTE
: For a detailed explanation of the Arrival export logic, please see
Arrival Export Logic Explained
.
9. Configure Reporting Tab (Optional)
The
Reporting
tab is used to export a csv or json file that generates guest information from
RTP|One
to be used for emailing guests with missing profile information needed prior to their activity start.
The data for this report is downloaded from
RTP|One
once daily at 5:00AM resort’s local time but the Aspenware Team can update this defaulted time upon request. You can see on the
Reporting
tab the last time the report was run.
Once downloaded the list can be used with your CRM to decide how and when to contact guests via email distribution. Continue reading below for details on what the configuration in the Reporting tab achieves. You’ll also find examples with descriptions of what is included in the standard report and details report.
Location
: This dropdown displays all of your active
POS
Locations in Arrival. You can only select one Location at a time and when you download a report only guests with both an outstanding task in
RTP|One
and with a matching task assigned to this location will be included in the report.
Begin Date:
Defines the starting date the report will generate information based on the start date of an order/transaction in
RTP|One
. A max of 5 months in the past can be selected.
End Date
: Defines the ending date the report will generate information based on the start date of an order/transaction in
RTP|One
. Any date in the future can be selected.
NOTE
: A guest with a non-date-based product will be returned here if
RTP|One
requires that task for completion and the Arrival POS Location has a matching task.
Include Printable media:
Selecting this will have the report include information for guests that have a printable media product purchased and has not yet been printed in
RTP|One
. Once logged in to Arrival, guests will see a QR code on their account that can be scanned at PUBs for printing.
Deselecting this will omit guests who only have outstanding printable media and will only generate information on guests who have outstanding tasks based on the POS Location and date range selected.
Includes Details:
Deselecting this will generate a Standard Report and selecting this will generate a Detailed Report.
Standard Report
: Attached below is an example of Arrival’s standard report with descriptions of the data each column is generating. It is recommended to use this report as the distribution list to send to customers. Displays the head of household’s contact details if the head of household or anyone in the household in
RTP|One
requires a task to be completed with a matching task at this Arrival Location.
Details Report
: Attached below is an example of Arrival’s Details Report with descriptions of the data each column is generating. It is recommended to use this report for data validation and not as a distribution list to send to guests. Displays the head of household’s contact details AND the household participant’s details if the head of household or household in
RTP|One
requires a task to be completed with a matching task at this Arrival Location.

CSV Export:
Selecting this will generate the report in CSV formatting. Deselecting this will generate the report in json formatting.
Test Customer Activities
: This is primarily used as a validation tool, inputting a guest’s IP code from
RTP|One
will return information on their outstanding tasks in json formatting.
IMPORTANT
: A guest with a non-date-based product will be returned in the export if
RTP|One
needs that task completed and the Arrival POS Location has a matching task).
10. Configure API Tab
Arrival’s API tab is used to export guest information from
RTP|One
to your CRM tool and the API is available to any CRM that develops the capability to call the data. Your CRM does not need to log in to Arrival as guest information is secured through an API key that can be provided to them. Once the CRM has access to the API, the CRM can configure specific parameters they call on; simply put: the CRM is able to import the guest information for the exact guests that should be emailed for Arrival tasks
IF
they have this specified. If they do not have anything specified when they make the API call, they receive Arrival’s default parameters; default parameters are set on Arrival’s API screen and described in this article section below.
NOTE
: The data available through the API is obtained through the same method as the
Reporting
tab. It is downloaded from
RTP|One
once daily at 5:00AM resort’s local time but the Apenware Team can update this defaulted time upon request. Once downloaded, the list can be used with your CRM to decide how and when to contact guests via email distribution.
API Access Keys
: In order for a CRM to obtain guest information, you must provide them with an API key from this list. Copy and paste existing API keys to share with your CRM(s). If you click the red trash can icon, this will delete an existing API and would break any established connections your CRM has through that key.
Create API Token:
This generates a unique API key to call the data Arrival has obtained from
RTP|One
. You can create multiple API keys if you need to share with multiple systems and want to keep the keys unique. To create an API Key:
Click
CREATE API TOKEN
.
Input a
Token Nickname
: ie: {CRM Name}
Click
CREATE TOKEN
.
API Default Settings
: This is the defaulted information a CRM will obtain when they call the API IF the CRM has not specified specific parameters. The two sections here function the same as the Reporting Tab’s “Begin Date” and “End Date”.
Days Before Current Day
: Defines the starting date the report will generate information based on the start date (product date) of an order/transaction in
RTP|One
. A max of 5 months in the past can be selected.
Days After Current Day
: Defines the ending date the report will generate information based on the start date (product) of an order/transaction in
RTP|One
. Any date in the future can be selected.
IMPORTANT
: A guest with a non-date-based product will be returned in the results if
RTP|One
needs that task completed and the Arrival POS Location has a matching task.
After you have updated these two fields click
UPDATE DEFAULT SETTINGS
and if your CRM has not specified these parameters, the next time they call on Arrival’s API they will receive guest information based on this date range.
Available API Endpoints & Documentation
: This section describes information on how to call the API and the parameters that can be specified.
11. Ensure Arrival QR Codes Are Aligned With Pick up Box Approach
QR codes will be displayed in Arrival for guests to use to pick up media at either an
Axess
PUB or
Skidata
Skiosk. Printing media requires that line items are auto-fulfilled. Open Order lines cannot be printed on either device.
Axess PUB Approach:
Arrival will display a QR Code of each family member’s IPCodes, which will be able to be scanned at the PUB for pass media pickup. Only family members with pass media to pickup will be displayed in Arrival.
QR Codes will only display if:
Pass Media is in an
RTP|One
Sales Transaction (either directly or as part of auto-fulfilled order line);
The media Product Header in
RTP|One
has “
Axess Print on PUB
” rule added;
Pass Media is not returned;
Guest has an image - only if it is required by the Pass Media;
Guest has completed all required waivers associated to the transaction line; and
Pass Media has not already been printed.
Note
: Ensure the “General” Tab settings “Display External Order ID as QR Code“ is aligned with the PUB type in use at the resort:
For resorts using Axess PUBs, either the ExternalOrderID or IPCode can be used.
For resorts using Skidata Skiosks, ExternalOrderID must be used.
Skidata Skiosk Approach:
Arrival will display QR Codes of
RTP|One
External Order IDs that are associated with family members who have media to pick up. (Skiosk does not support IPCodes or any other
RTP|One
values.)
This will print any media in the order (even if for members outside of the family).
QRCodes will only display if:
Pass Media is in an
RTP|One
Sales Transaction (must be fulfilled or auto-fulfilled from an Order with an External Order ID);
Product Header in
RTP|One
has “
SkiData Print on PUB
” rule added;
Pass Media is not returned;
Guest has an image - only if it is required by the Pass Media;
Guest has completed all required waivers associated to the transaction line; and
Pass Media has not already been printed.
Note
: Ensure the “General” Tab settings “Display External Order ID as QR Code“ is aligned with the PUB type in use at the resort.
12. Configure Collections Tab
This is leveraged with the Arrival Pass Checker Functionality and is fully detailed in the
Pass Checker Configuration guide
.
13. Set Up Custom Analytics (Optional)
A series of customer events are triggered when a guest takes an action. Each action is registered as a single arrival_event and split out according to the task performed. This enables a record of each action taken by a user allowing the resort to collect and analyze information. Custom events show resorts exactly how many times an event was performed on the application providing powerful data that can be leveraged to best serve your customers and improve the user experience. Data can be seen via Google Analytics (legacy or the latest version 4). Following is a list of custom events and a snapshot of an example Google Analytics dashboard below.

Q: A guest is receiving an email to complete tasks that they have already completed.
Q: Why are guests being emailed that they have a waiver to complete that they have already signed?
A: Ensure there is not a mis-match of Validation Date configuration across Arrival and
RTP|One
Authorization configuration. A mismatch could result in guests being emailed that they have a waiver to complete that they have already signed, or vice versa. The arrival export, which determines the list of guests to email who have unsigned waivers to complete keys off the validation date set up on the waiver in
RTP|One
, while Arrival determines whether a waiver task is needed for a guest once they login to Arrival based on the validation date configured on the waiver task in Arrival. These
MUST
be aligned.
Q: A guest is receiving an email to complete tasks that they have already completed.
A: Because the email list is pre-processed, any changes in the list that happen after it is generated will not be accounted for throughout the day. For example, if the file is generated at 5am and emails are sent out at 5:30am, it is possible that a guest’s tasks to complete or media to pick up may have changed either due to them completing those tasks or something changing in
RTP|One
like a transaction being returned.

Auto-hotlisting
is a feature that enables resorts to restrict lift access by pass media code for guests who do not have a valid liability waiver. As part of the sale of a product that requires a liability waiver, Aspenware provides the ability to flag
pass media codes
that are in need of a valid authorization profile in RTP. Then, once the waiver is signed through Aspenware’s Resort Tools, Arrival or Commerce platform, hotlisting is removed and the guest may access the lift.
This feature is available for resorts that have purchased Arrival or Resort Tools and use RTP as their point-of-sale system.
When Should I Use This Feature?
This feature should be used if you want to restrict guests who do not have valid liability waivers on file from accessing their media-accessible activity.
Prerequisites
Ensure that products are configured as they normally would in RTP by attaching Authorization Types to product components.  Typically Authorization Types are added to Access components in
RTP|One
.
Configuration Guide
You will need to work with your Aspenware Service Agent to implement this feature.
1. Complete the questionnaire
To begin setup of this feature, determine the answers to the following questions and submit them to your  Service Agent (
support@aspenware.com):
Is Authorization on Acess or Pass Media Components?
Do you want to add hotlisting to day products, season-long products, or both?
What is the Authorization Type code(s) you’d like to hotlist?
What is the Authorization Expiration Date?
What is the Hotlist date(s)?
What are the Access Hotlist code(s)?
2. Configure Setup Table (Aspenware)
Aspenware will set up a table in which RTP Authorization Type codes are mapped to an Access Hotlist code and a stored procedure is then scheduled to run every X minutes.
3. C
ustomize Stored Procedure (Optional - Aspenware)
As an option, we can customize the RTP stored procedure,
proc_publicGetCustomerAuthorizationValidation
to prevent the RTP authorization window from popping up when completing an RTP transaction. This can be configured by RTP Client Code which allows you to define which clients should continue showing the RTP Authorization pop-up and which clients should not display it

Aspenware Arrival helps bridge the technological gap in the ski industry by bringing proven mechanics inspired from Airline check-in. Arrival’s ample configuration options provide a platform that encourages creativity, which will continue to grow as more features are added. Even if your resort sells exclusively through an eCommerce channel that requires the guest to complete all product requirements, you’ll see benefits from the Arrival application. Aspenware worked closely with resort partners to flush out use cases for the Arrival application, which are outlined in this document.
Open image-20201030-040042.png
Edit Profile
- Your resort can configure a location for updating profiles that were previously filled out online. This includes rental and child reg profiles.
Simplify Ecommerce to increase conversions
- Your resort can remove child registration and rental profile from Ecommerce flows and collect them later using Arrival. This can help increase your conversion rates.
Orders not placed in Ecommerce
- Your resort can utilize Arrival for orders not placed online. You can require guests to collect info before arrival for products purchased through these channels (i.e. call center orders, Inntopia orders).
Walk-up guests
- Your resort can display QR codes on site that guests can use to navigate to Arrival. Guests can complete tasks before they reach sales agents, thus streamlining the process.
Sending QR codes
- Your resort can send guests links to Arrival to pull up QR codes closer to their trip. This helps guests by reducing the number of emails they have to dig through. Emails can also remind guests that they can use PUBs to print their media.
Verify Emergency Contacts
- Guests can confirm child registration profiles prior to lesson drop-off to verify that emergency contacts in child registration profiles are approved to pick up the child post-lesson.
Covid health check waivers
- If your resort requires these waivers, you can set up a special Covid waiver location with an authorization type that is required every day.
Lift ticket window purchases -
You can provide a QR code onsite to help guests get started with their purchase. Guests will be directed to an Arrival URL focused on Lift Tickets, providing a singl waiver sign task. Guests will have the option to add family members who are also purchasing tickets. The entire family can check-in and sign the waivers. By the time they get to the window, all members of the family are created with valid birthdates, all waivers are signed, and the sales agent can quickly assign purchases in RTP.
Season pass office
-
When an employee at the pass office determines a guest has to sign a waiver, they can direct the guest to a QR code displayed at the stand for the guest to sign the waiver on their phone, including any family members.
RTP|One
is updated in real-time as the guest completes their waiver(s). This can also be used to capture a guests photo.
Hotel concierge
-
Hotels can offer guidance including printed material with an easy way to make sure guests are ready for their activities the following day. The QR codes included in the material can take the guest straight to check-in tasks based on purchases the guest has previously made.
Hot-listed media at the lift
- You can hotlist media of guests who have outstanding waivers. Gate staff/lift attendants can be equipped with an iPad or QR code to give to a guest if they discover their media is hot-listed due to a missing waiver. The guest can step out of line momentarily, sign all their waivers on their phone and proceed through the gate.
Products that may not require a purchase
-
You may offer an activity that requires a waiver but not a purchase. For example, free babysitting or a kid’s movie night. Guests can scan the code and sign a waiver without a corresponding purchase/transaction. Couple this with a child registration and parents can go on their way.
Rental equipment tuning/tech station
- If the guest brings their skis in for adjustment – whether rentals or personal equipment – you can require the guest to fill out a rental profile at the tech station and sign the appropriate waiver.

Resort Tools reduces time spent waiting in line for guests and time spent by resort staff checking guests in across your resort.
Overview
Resort Tools encompasses two products that can be used in one of two ways or in tandem for the optimal onsite guest experience. The two offerings are as follows:
Resort Tools - Kiosk
Resort Tools - Kiosk
is designed for guests to complete the required information at a resort kiosk Our user-facing kiosk is designed to capture required information in your rental stores, pass offices and lesson locations. The streamlined user flow is designed for ease of use and accurate customer profiles. Resorts mitigate risk with the careful completion and collection of required documents.
All guests at a particular location will be guided through the same process, which is optimized for that location. The product can operate without an internet connection if configured for offline use. Guests can use a fast-flow option with pre-filled information, but personalization based on guest data and order details is unavailable. If personalization is important,
Aspenware Arrival
may be a better option. To use Resort Tools - Kiosk, a Resort Tools or Aspenware Arrival license is required.

Orders Creation in SWEB from RTP Sales Transactions

Ongoing Support and Maintenance
This solution supports the use of the SKIDATA Skiosk to print media from an RTP order or sales transaction.  Sales that contain deferred printable media from RTP are uploaded to SKIDATA’s SWEB tool which can then be printed on the Skiosk.  Once printed, SKIDATA sends the RFID back to RTP and marks the media as printed.  The media can then be used for validation in RTP.
Solution Overview
There are 4 main aspects to this solution.  1) SKIDATA DTA/SWEB, 2) Unity Contractor Service, 3) Unity DTA Jobs, and 4) RTP.
Open image-20230425-162904.png
SKIDATA DTA/SWEB
SKIDATA provides access to SWEB during the implementation and will also provide training on the tool.  Typically SWEB is accessed often during the initial implementation phase to verify interfaced products and orders but then less after go-live.  The interface between Aspenware and SKIDATA only uses a small portion of SWEB which is also used with SKIDATAs POS and parking system.
SKIDTA Skiosks
This is the hardware that prints RFID cards (shown above).
DTA
This is the name of the interface used by a 3rd party system to interact with SKIDATA’s system.
SWEB
SWEB is the name of the user interface used by the SKIDATA Skiosks and can be used to view interfaced products and orders.  The printing template the Skiosks use is also defined in SWEB.
Open image-20230425-181722.png
Unity Contactor Service
The Unity Contractor Service is an Aspenware-created Windows IIS application that is installed locally at the resort. The application is used for for 2 purposes which are to create products in SKIDATA’s SWEB application (via the catalog import function) and to upload the RFID from the Skiosk back into RTP and to mark the media as printed.
An RTP Client Code is defined in the SKIDATA SWEB tool which is used in the catalog import process to lookup products in RTP that are eligible to be printed on the Skoisk.  A product is created in SWEB for each RTP product and a mapping is automatically defined to the RTP product header code.  Only products that are interfaced to SWEB through the catalog import process are then eligible to printed on the Skiosks.  Once printed, SWEB sends the RFID back to the Unity Contractor Service where it is uploaded into RTP’s ExternalAccessMap table and the media is marked as printed in the TransactionProductOutput table.
Unity DTA Jobs
The Unity DTA Jobs service is also an Aspenware-created Windows IIS application that is installed locally at the resort.  This application polls RTP’s TransactionProductOutput table every minute for new records.  Only transactions with products that have previously been interfaced to SKIDATA’s SWEB tool (via the catalog import) will be picked up by the service and sent to SKIDATA to create an order.  An Order is created in SWEB with a reference to the RTP Sales Transaction ID, Order ID or External Order ID which is used to retrieve the order and print (usually from a QR or barcode).
RTP
RTP sales transactions and fulfilled orders that contain deferred media of season pass and access products are eligible to be printed on the Skiosks.  As mentioned previously, the products must first be included in the catalog import process and interfaced to SWEB before a sales transaction or fulfilled order containing deferred media will be created in SWEB as an Order.
RTP Client Code
The RTP Client Code defined in SWEB will be used by the catalog import to lookup which products meet the criteria to be included in the import process.
Products must be priced in RTP for the day the catalog import runs.
An existing RTP Client Code can be used or a new one can be created.  The Sale Location assigned to the Client in RTP can also be an existing sale location or a new one dedicated to a new Skiosk Location.  The benefit of using a new sale location is that products could be priced for all dates.  If products are only priced for part of the year, it is likely multiple catalog imports will need to be performed in order to interface those products to SWEB making transactions and orders that contain these products eligible to be printed on the Skiosks.  If products are available all season, then it is possible only a single catalog import will need to be run at the beginning of the season.
The Client Code will also be uploaded into several RTP tables as the client code that printed the media (i.e. TransactionProductOutput.OutputClientCode).
Detailed Setup Guide
The following instructions detail the setup steps for using the SKIDATA Skiosk to print media from an RTP order or sales transaction.
Set Up SWEB Contractor
Import SWEB Catalog
Configure SWEB Print Mask (Media Template)
Install Aspenware IIS Application
Test UnityDTAJobs Install
Trigger Sending of RTP Transactions to SKIDATA/SWEB
Select Testing Method
Add Rules to Product Header Codes
Go Live
1. Set Up SWEB Contractor
The Unity Contractor Service URL is define in SWEB which is where SKIDATA will configure a Contractor entry. Aspenware will provide the URL to the Unity Contractor Service once it is setup or will add the URL to SWEB.  This can be found in SWEB in Sales Management / Tenants / Contractors.
Following is an example from Aspenware’s test environment.
Edit the Contractor entry and then navigate to the Contractor System tab to define the URL.

Open image-20230425-203448.png
2. Click ‘Check Connectivity’ to test the connection from SKIDATA’s SWEB tool to the Unity Contractor Service installed locally at the resort.  The URL format is below but will differ for each install =
https://servername.com/UnityContractorService/ContractorService.svc
Open image-20230425-203735.png
Open image-20230502-153641.png
2. Import SWEB Catalog
SKIDATA will configure portions of SWEB prior to the first catalog import.  The catalog import can be found in SWEB in Sales Management > Configuration > Catalogs and there is typically only one entry created for the resort.  The RTP Client Code that will be used to lookup products in RTP is defined in the External ID field (see below).  At least one catalog import will need to be completed prior to any attempt to print from the Skiosks.
Open image-20230425-202054.png
To start the catalog import, click the
Import
button along the top ribbon. Then click
Start Import
.
Open image-20230425-202607.png
2. The import process only takes a few seconds.  To view the products imported, click the Products button along the top ribbon.
Open image-20230425-202713.png
3. If the import was successful, products will show in the list.  Use the gear/settings icon to show the External Id column which shows the RTP Product Header code.
Open image-20230425-202911.png
3. Configure SWEB Print Mask (Media Template)
The catalog import also configures a Print Mask in SWEB which is the media template that prints when a Skiosk order is fulfilled.  This is located in Sales Management > Configuration > Print Masks.  Each time the catalog imports runs, the print mask gets set back to the default which some customers do not use.
It is recommended to define the Print Mask during testing and then to export the template from SWEB and then re-import after each catalog import.
The default template pulls a description from one of the Unity Contractor Service configuration files so this could be used to define a short text line on the template (e.g., Winter 22-23).  Some customers use this and therefore need to remember to update the configuration file after each season.  Each time the configuration file is updated, a catalog import will need to be performed to add the new descriptions to SWEB.  The text is located in the web.config file in the DTA ticketText field.  Additional information can be found on this in the install section of this guide.
Open image-20230425-210309.png
Double click the entry above to edit the template.
Open image-20230425-211351.png
2. To export the template, click
Miscellaneous
in the upper right corner and then the
Export
button.  This will download a JSON file that can be used to import the template using the same method after the next catalog import.
Open image-20230425-211446.png
3. To import, click the
Import Template
button.
Open image-20230425-211609.png
4. Install Aspenware IIS Application
Aspenware will perform 2 installations on Unity in conjunction with this implementation.
Install Unity Contractor Service
Aspenware will install the Unity Contractor Service on a server at the resort that is accessible to the SKIDATA web services.  SKIDATA will provide the IP range of the traffic so that the server can be locked down.  The Unity Contractor Service is an IIS application that is accessed by SKIDATA for the catalog import function and to upload printed RFID’s to RTP.
The following config/json files contain all the configuration values needed for the service.
Rtp-config.json
– contains all RTP configuration values
SalesChannelCode:
Sales channel used for the product catalog import.  Products need to be priced for the day the catalog imports runs and to have output added in RTP for the sales channel defined.
UserID
: This must be a valid user with a valid UserSession.SessionToken in RTP.  This user will be the OperatorID that printed the media in several RTP database tables.
Database Connection string (server, db, SQL user)
: Aspenware will create a new SQL Role and User and the Role needs to have privileges to the following tables.  Aspenware can configure this in SSMS or provide a script.

Open image-20230502-153258.png
ticketText:
Text data is imported during catalog import to SWEB/Print Mask, ‘Text Print Mask Item 1’. If text is changed directly in SWEB, data will be overwritten with text defined in web.config in next catalog import.  If this media element is not added to the Print Mask in SWEB, there is no need to update this from season to season.
priceCategoryName:
Text data is imported during catalog import to SWEB/Price Category.  This description does not show during fulfillment but does show in SKIDATA admin.  Typically this description is set to match the same description of ticketText above.
seasonStartDate
&
seasonEndDate:
Dates are imported during catalog import to SWEB/Time Periods.  Aspenware recommends defining a large data range to avoid having to update each season since this data only shows in SKIDATA admin.

Test the Unity Contractor Service install by entering the URL into a browser to verify a service page displays instead of an error page.
Example of URL:
https://aspenware.com/UnityContractorService/ContractorService.svc
Install Unity DTA Jobs
Aspenware will install the Unity DTA Jobs on a server at the resort that is accessible to the SKIDATA DTA web services.  SKIDATA will provide the IP range of the traffic so that the server can be locked down.  The Unity DTA Jobs is an IIS application that is used to look up transactions in RTP that have deferred output and to create orders in SKIDATA’s SWEB application.  Microsoft’s dotnet-hosting will also need to be installed on the server hosting the UnityDTAJobs application.
The UnityDTA Jobs service uses Hangfire which is a 3rd party product used to perform background processing in .NET and .NET Core applications.  Hangfire has several database tables that will also need to be deployed which are described below.
Install UnityDTAJobs database
Aspenware has scripts to install the UnityDTAJobs database which also include database tables for Hangfire.  These tables track which RTP transactions have been sent to SKIDATA/SWEB.  See below for screenshot of the tables included in the UnityDTAJobs database.
Open image-20230509-145344.png
Configure UnityDTAJobs
The following config/json files contain all the configuration values needed for the UnityDTAJobs service.
appsettings.json

5. Test UnityDTAJobs Install
Once installed, navigate to
http://localhost/UnityDTAJobs/hangfire/
in a browser on the machine hosting the application.  If the install was successful, the Hangfire Dashboard should show rather than an error page.  The Realtime Graph below shows the number of transactions processed and the History Graph shows the total uptime of the Hangfire service.
Open image-20230502-183550.png
6. Trigger Sending RTP Transactions to SKIDATA/SWEB
The UnityDTAJobs IIS application uses the dta.LastProcessedTransaction table to track the transactions that have already been sent to SKIDATA.  During the implementation, the ProcessDate will be set to a date in the past and will begin processing once the IIS application is started.  Once the date catches up to the current date, only new transactions containing deferred output will be processed moving forward.

Every RTP transaction is reviewed by the service to see if there is any deferred output that meets the criteria to be sent to SKIDATA to create an order.  The criteria is that the product in the transaction has been previously interfaced to SKIDATA using the product catalog import and that the product has the Rule, ‘Skidata Print PUB’ added (See rules information below).  Each RTP transaction ID that meets the criteria, will be created in SWEB as an Order and the DTAOrderID will be recorded in the dta.Reservation table.
Open image-20230502-184402.png
The DTAOrderID will also be updated into RTP’s TransactionHeader table in the OfflineTransactionID field.

Below shows an Order in SWEB created from RTP Transaction ID, 101525809.  If the order originated from an Aspenware online order, the ConfirmationNumber will be the RTP ExternalOrderID (i.e. PK12345).

7. Select Testing Method
It is possible to point all the services to RTPOneTest to perform testing but it is easier to test against RTPOne prod instead.  The main issue with using RTPOneTest is that SKIDATA does not have a test system so it’s possible that an RTP TransactionID that was interfaced to SKIDATA/SWEB during testing from RTPOneTest will exist in RTPOne production as a real customer’s TransactionID.  The SKIDATA development team can clear out orders that were created during testing but using the method below against RTPOne prod is preferred for testing.
Below is an outline to perform initial testing without interfacing all RTP transactions to SKIDATA SWEB.
Set the dta.LastProcessedTransaction table to have a ProcessDate of today for all rows.
Recycle the UnityDTAJobs application pool (or start the service).
Create or clone an RTP Product Header that contains media output that has never been sold to a customer and add all three Skiosk related Rules (Unity Attribute - Age, Unity Attribute - Duration, and SkiData Print on PUB).
In SKIDATA SWEB, start the product catalog import and verify the new product shows up
If no product, review the SWEB DTA Transaction Logs for any errors.
If no errors in DTA Transaction Logs, review the UnityContractorService log
If no errors in the UnityContractorService log, start SQL trace to see call hitting RTP and manually run in SSMS.  This may reveal that the product does not meet the criteria to be interfaced (pricing, sales channel, sale location, etc).
In RTP, create a sales transaction and sell the product created in step 1 above.  Make sure to defer media during the sale.
In SWEB, make sure you see an Order show up within a minute or two.
If no order in SWEB, verify the UnityDTAJobs IIS application is running (verify the application pool is started).
If UnityDTAJobs is running, check error log.
If no errors, verify there is deferred output in RTP’s Deferred Output Tool.
Check the UnityDTAJobs table, dta.Reservation for the most recent entries to see if there are errors.
Create a barcode or QR code of the RTP TransactionID and attempt to use at Skiosk.
If nothing prints, re-verify the Transactions is in SWEB as an Order
If Order exists but nothing prints, ask SKIDATA to check the Skiosk log (which is located directly on the PC inside the Skiosk hardware.
If media prints, verify the RFID can be used to perform a search in RTP.
If RFID cannot be searched successfully in RTP, look for errors in the UnityContractorService log.
Repeat steps above for an RTP OrderID that is manually created and fulfilled in RTP and for an online order.
For an Order created directly in RTP, use the RTP OrderID as the barcode/QR code at the Skiosk.
For an online order, use the RTP ExternalOrderID as the barcode/QR code at the Skiosk.
8. Add Rules to Product Header Code(s)
Three Product Header Rules need to be added to any product that will be printed from the Skiosk.
IMPORTANT
:
DO NOT ADD THESE RULES UNTIL GO-LIVE.
More info on this can be found in the testing section of this document below.
Rule 1: Unity Attribute - Duration
Add Duration rule to Product Header Codes per the diagram and define a value of 1.
Open image-20230613-212505.png
Duration Rule
Rule 2: Unity Attribute - Age
Add Age rule to Product Header Codes per the diagram and define a value of 1.
Open image-20230613-212816.png
Age Rule
Rule 3: SkiData Print on PUB
Add SkiData Print on PUB Rule to Product Header Codes and define a value of TRUE.

SKIDATA Print on PUB Rule
Open image-20230425-182209.png
Example of Rules added to PHC
Configure Product components to have Output and to Allow Deferral.
NOTE
: If after go-live, the resort realizes they did not add the three Rules to all products, the catalog import can be run again and the ProcessDate in the dta.LastProcessedTransaction can be set back to a date in the past.  The service will run and skip over any transaction it has already processed and only create orders in SWEB for transactions containing the new products.  This process will also take a few hours because every transaction is reviewed again by the service.
9. Go Live
Going live with the Skiosks means ensuring all products in RTP have the three rules added and then setting the ProcessDate in the dta.LastProcessedTransaction to a date in the past.  If the testing method above was followed, there should be no need to clear out data in the dta.Reservation table.
Stop the UnityDTAJobs application pool.
Ensure the 3 product header rules have been added to all products.
(SEE SECTION ABOVE)
Start the product catalog import in SWEB
Ask the resort to review the list of products.  If products are missing, ask the resort to add the three Rules to additional products and/or verify the product(s) are priced for ‘today'.
Repeat this step until the resort verifies all products are showing in SWEB.
Set the dta.LastProcessedTransaction table to have a ProcessDate in the past.  This should be the date of or right before the date they started selling media products for the season.
Start the UnityDTAJobs application pool.
Verify Orders are showing in SKIDATA SWEB.  This process can take a few hours depending on how far back the date goes and how many total transaction's the resort has.
To verify the initial load of Orders is complete, verify the ProcessDate for the Reservation column now shows today’s date.
Orders Creation in SWEB from RTP Sales Transactions
The Unity DTA Service is always running in the customer’s environment and is looking for new RTP transactions that contain deferred pass media and access output.  The products in these transactions need to have the Product Header Rule, SkiData Print On PUB and the products must currently be in SWEB from a catalog import.  If all these conditions are met, an Order gets created in SWEB which can be viewed in Sales Management > Monitoring > Orders (see below).  Once the Order is created in SWEB, it can then be printed from the Skiosk.
If an order or is cancelled in RTP or the fulfillment transactions has been returned, the order is then cancelled in SKIDATA/SWEB and cannot be printed.
The ‘Confirmation Number’ that appears in SWEB will be the RTP Sales Transaction ID if the deferred output is associated with an RTP sales transaction (completed directly in RTP), an RTP OrderID if the deferred output originated from an RTP order (completed directly in  RTP), or the ExternalOrderID if the sale originated from an Aspenware order (or any 3rd party processing orders into RTP).
This is the only value mapped to the SKIDATA Order and is the only value that can be used to find and print the order on the Skiosk.
In other words, for an Aspenware order, only the ExternalOrderID will get mapped to the Order in SWEB so only that value can be used to find the order and print the media from the Skiosk.  The RTP OrderID from Aspenware’s order cannot be used to find the order in SWEB.
Open image-20230425-223635.png
Ongoing Support and Maintenance
Depending on the products being printed on the Skiosks, additional product catalog imports may need to be run in the future.  Some resorts have very few products that haven’t changed from year to year so they may have only used the catalog import function during the initial implementation.  Resorts that are not bundling media with access on product headers may have very few media product headers and therefore very few interfaced products in SKIDATA/SWEB.  Resorts that bundle media and access may have dozens or hundreds of products interfaced to SKIDATA/SWEB.
The key thing to remember is that ‘todays’ date is used when the catalog import runs so if a resort does not have pricing setup until their opening date (i.e. 11/15/2024), then running the catalog import in October will not interface products to SKIDATA/SWEB.
As mentioned above, each time the catalog import is run in SWEB, the Print Mask resets back to the default so if the resort isn’t using the default, they will need to import the Print Mask file after each import.

The Aspenware Scanning application integrates into RTP’s access control system and can be used to process online and offline scans.  The application runs on handheld devices running Android kitkat up to version 11 of Android  (version 4.4 to version 11) which also have the DataWedge application (typically Zebra devices).  The devices connect via http or https to a server within the resorts internal local area network (LAN) running Aspenware’s Unity API.  Unity then communicates to the RTP database on the resorts LAN to verify scanning data and retrieve customer information.  The Unity API can be installed on the existing RTP application server or on another server located within the resort’s LAN.
The devices should be configured on the resorts local area network (LAN) and not a through a public wireless access point.  The devices should not have access to the internet, and it is the resorts responsibility to secure access to the scanner data and network traffic.  It is also recommended to disable Bluetooth and any cellular networks on the device.
There are 3 main aspects of this solution, 1) Android Device (AWScanning.apk), 2) Unity, and 3) RTP
Open image-20210512-191746.png
Settings Overview
The Aspenware Scanning application settings allow configuring the device behavior on the Login page and when scanning barcodes and reading RFID media cards.  The Login page can be configured to require scanning barcodes/RFID cards in order to sign-in as well as to require the user of a valid RTP UserID.  To gain access to the device settings, manually enter or scan a barcode of the word, ‘SETTINGS’.  This will automatically display the settings page on the device.
Open image-20210512-191826.png
Open image-20210512-191832.png
Web Service
– defines connectivity information for the device to connect to Unity.
Device
– defines DeviceID as well as behavior of the Login page.  See below for more info on each setting.
Sound Settings
– defines sound and vibration settings for offline, validate only and live  scans.  See below for more info on sound settings.
UHF Scan Settings
– only displays on a device that is configured to use UHF.  These settings control the default trigger mode, range of the UHF reader and RFID conversion type.  See below for more info on each setting.
Settings - Web Service
Open image-20210512-192136.png
The web service URL must be entered in the following format including the trailing slash:  https://<servername>/Unity/ (i.e.
https://aspenwarecommerce.net/UnityProd/
)
Client Id – defined during implementation. Do not change.
Client Secret – defined during implementation. Do not change.
Settings - Device Settings
The login page is configurable through Device Settings to allow the following options.
Open image-20210512-192223.png
Device ID
– defines the ID used to record scans in RTP.  Recommend defining a unique Device ID per device.
Require Location Scan
– determines whether user can manually select Access Location or if scanning a barcode is required to sign-in.  If set to Y, user must scan a valid AccessLocationCode from RTP (i.e barcode of 100, 110, 120, etc.)
Validate UserID
– determines whether username is a validated against RTP.  If enabled, a valid RTP UserID must be used to sign-in.
Force Login Scan
– determines whether a user must scan a pass media barcode or read an RFID card to sign-in.  If enabled, the RTP IPCode the pass belongs to must be added to a UserID in Admin/Security Administration/User in RTP:
Open image-20210512-192321.png
Enable Add Customer ID
–enables functionality to allow operator to enter an RTP Customer ID (IPCode) when a certain RTP Access Error is returned as a scan result.  After entering customer ID, a new scan will be triggered that appends the {CustomerID} to the end of the previously scanned code.
Customer ID Scan Code –
click to enter a specific RTP Access Error ‘Error Message’ for the Enable Add Customer ID functionality.  This will be the only RTP Access Error that will trigger this functionality to allow an operator to enter a Customer ID (IPCode).  For example, ‘Bad Type’ is entered below so when this scan result is returned to the scanner, the ‘Add Customer ID’ option will display allowing the operator to enter an RTP IPCode.
Open image-20210512-192356.png
After scan occurs that returns this type, the Add Customer ID button appears:
Open image-20210512-192410.png
Which allows the operator to enter data which then gets appended to the previously scanned code and triggers a new scan:

Open image-20210512-192550.png
Settings - Sound Settings
Sound settings define the sound generated for an Offline, Validate Only and Live Scan on the device.  Several sounds are delivered in each category and custom sounds can also be uploaded as of v1.14 of the app.  You can also define whether the device vibrates with each type of sound by checking the Vibrate checkbox.
For Live Scans, ‘Beep’ settings are used to map to valid and invalid scans from RTP Access Rule Product Type administration.  Settings for 1 and 3 Beeps are delivered with the device and map to a valid and invalid scan from RTP (3 is always an invalid scan in RTP).  Additional Beeps can be added which map to RTP’s Access Rule Product Type administration entries.  To add new Beeps, click the ‘New Setting’ button below and define an un-used Beep Count, Sound and Vibrate setting.  ‘4 Beeps’ has been added in the screen shot below.  After adding a new setting, you must click the ‘Save Settings’ button.
Open image-20210512-192832.png
To upload custom sounds
, place a .wav file in the devices Notification directory and select the custom sound file when defining new beeps or when editing the Offline and/or Validate Only settings.  For example, in the screen shots below, the ‘LightningSound.wav’ was uploaded to the device making it available to select through the app.

Settings - UHF Scan Settings
The UHF Scan Settings are configurable to allow adjusting the default behavior of the trigger, the transmit power of the device as well as the type of RFID’s populated into the device.
Open image-20230118-223307.png
Open image-20230118-223228.png
Trigger Mode
Barcode and RFID – allows the scanner to scan barcodes and read RFID tags.  When this is enabled, a barcode will be read first even if an RFID tag is in range.
RFID Only – only allows the scanner to scan RFID tags.
Use Max Transmit Power
– impacts the range of the scanner.  When enabled, the max range of the device will be used to scan RFID tags.  The max range for the Zebra MC3300 is 270 but this can differ per device.  This value is a numeric value that relates to a dBm value (decibels with reference to one milliwatt.)  The Zebra MC3300 has a range of 0-30 dBm so a value of 270 is equivalent to 30 dBM.
Transmit Power
– used when Use Max Transmit Power is disabled and defines transmit power other than the max value.  It is likely that this setting will need to be adjusted for each customer to find the optimal setting.  A lower value (i.e. 30 or 50) makes it easier to scan a specific tag while a higher value allows reading tags from greater distances.
Set Tag Population
– enabled or disabled.
Tag Population
– if Set Tag Population is enabled, this value defines the estimated number of tags that will be in range of the scanner.
Convert IDs to Base 32
– enabled or disabled
If enabled, Id is converted to Base 32 (i.e. 1OG000B706016C1N1R02)
If disabled, Id is Base 16 (i.e. E28068900000000163F009B9)
Use TID Memory Bank
– enables the application to use the value stored in the TID memory bank instead of the default tagId.  Typically ‘Convert IDs to Base 32’ is also selected when this is enabled.
Use EPC Memory Bank
– enables the application to use the value stored in the EPC memory bank instead of the default tagId.  Typically ‘Convert IDs to Base 32’ is also selected when this is enabled.
Login Page
Based on how Login Settings are defined, the login page will appear with various options.
Login page requiring Login Scan but not a Location Scan. User must manually define the Access Location Group and Access Location:

Description
Airline passengers have been programmed to check-in 24 hours prior to their flights for years now. This allows the airline to capture information on the guest, saves time at the airport, and gives travelers peace of mind that their experience at the airport will be smooth. Aspenware Arrival provides this experience for guests coming to ski and ride at the resort. Guests can check in prior to arriving at the resort.
Guests interacting with Arrival will use the application to complete missing information or tasks required for their upcoming activities. For example:
If they have already purchased their resort products, but are missing required information, they may receive an email with a link to Arrival. These are most often automatically triggered to send 1-2 days prior to the guest’s activity via a CRM, based on the guest having an upcoming activity purchase that requires an Arrival task to be completed.
If they are purchasing on-premise and need to fill out information prior to checking out at a cashier, they may navigate to a Location URL (“Non-transaction driven” URL) from a QR code posted in the rental shop or pass office.
If they want to get easy access to the QR codes to print their non-printed media at a Pick Up Box at the resort, they may be prompted to download their unique QR codes to their Apple wallet from Arrival before their trip via a triggered email, or they might scan a QR code posted near the PUBs to be directed to get their unique QR code for printing in Arrival.
If they want to check to confirm whether their pass is ready to take direct to lift, they may go to pass checker via a link from the  a “make sure you’re prepared for your upcoming trip” email sent to them by the resort to validate that they have the right media on hand and access products purchased before they arrive.
Pass Media Redemption
QR codes will be displayed in Arrival for guests to use to pick up media at either an Axess PUB or Skidata Skiosk. For easy access, guests can also add these QR codes to various apps such as Apple Wallet and GPay.
Open image-20210618-161649.png
Pass Checker
On Arrival’s Pass Checker page, guests can look up their pass eligibility by either Pass# or RFID#. They can also filter between specific lifts and date combinations to check their pass eligibility. This is useful for resorts that limit lift access for specific gates and also for passes that have blackout dates.

How it works
Arrival uses Locations, Activities, and Tasks to determine what functions guests will be completing.
Locations
- A Resort can have several Locations. Each Location will have its own unique URL to which guests can navigate. Each Location requires a default activity. Examples of locations include:
“
POS Transactions
” - A “
POS Transactions
” Location might prompt users to complete tasks personalized to them based off of orders placed in your POS system. Whether through an eCommerce store such as Aspenware Commerce or placed directly into the POS through a phone call or resort visit.
“
Rental Shop”
A “
Rental Shop
” Location is most likely a configuration used for purchases made by guests who are physically at a rental location on-premise.
Activities
- An Activity is comprised of one or more tasks. These task may be related to a specific purchase. Examples include:
“
Purchases
” - This might be an Activity underneath the “
POS Transactions”
Location. This particular Activity will link to specific tasks that are required to be completed by the guest for the particular product purchases they have where they are missing required information.  The guest would only be prompted to fill out specific tasks that they are personally missing based on their orders.
“
Ski/Snowboard Rentals” -
This might be an Activity underneath the “
Rental Shop
” Location. Again, this particular Activity will link to specific tasks that are required to be completed by the guest for this particular product purchase.
Task
- A Task is the specific function that guests will be completing. Tasks supported in Arrival include:
Waiver Signing
Child Registration Capture
Rental Profile Capture
Photo Capture
, multiple selections available,

Prerequisite Tasks
This section describes all requirements that must be completed before you can begin setting up this feature. Once these tasks are complete continue to the next section.
General Tasks
Determine Arrival Strategy
Work with your Aspenware Representative to determine how Arrival will best be structured to meet the needs of your resort. Consider the following components.
Locations Overview
Locations are used to determine which activities guests will be completing. All Arrival implementations must include
ONE
default location, which is the Location used when navigating directly to your Arrival URL (e.g. http://arrival.yourresort.com/home ). Other (non-default) Locations are accessed by navigating to directories within your Resort’s Arrival URL (e.g. http://arrival.yourresort.com/mss-youth ).
When configuring a location, there are two inherent flows that will be configured at the Location level, transaction and location-driven options.
Transaction-Driven Configuration
- Using the transaction-based configuration, you can proactively reach out to guests with upcoming itineraries, prompting them to check-in in advance with tasks they are missing. Guests will complete tasks specific to what they have ordered through purchases made through your Aspenware Commerce store, the call center, your lodging eCommerce, etc. For example, a family that pre-purchased Season Passes online that has not yet signed waivers would be emailed a link to Arrival prior to their trip. They can sign in, and upon entering Arrival, their orders are recognized and they are prompted with relevant tasks.
Location-Driven Configuration
- The second configuration option is to catch guests who are purchasing onsite or who didn’t complete the required information prior to arrival, prompting them to fill in the required profiles and waivers onsite and on their personal devices. Different Locations can have different configurations and tasks depending on the activities offered at that location, (e.g., ski school, rental shop, etc.). For this flow, resorts can post QR codes around the resort linking to the location’s Arrival link. All guests who pull up these Arrival Location links on their devices will fill out the information that is specific to the Location where the guest is physically located. While some steps may be expedited if a guest has a completed profile or waiver on their account, the steps delivered to the guests through these location-driven flows are not catered to steps for orders on their profile, but rather steps required for that Location.
Prior to Arrival setup, determine how the resort will be using Locations. Some questions to answer include:
How many Locations will you have? Remember a Location doesn’t have to be a physical location - for example, your transaction-driven flows could all be linked to a “purchases” location.
Which Locations will be transaction vs location-driven?
For location-driven setup, determine which steps will be offered and which steps will be required.
Which guest types will you need to “follow up with” prior to their arrival on site or prior to fulfilling their product? Questions to consider include:
Do you need photos and or waivers to be updated prior to printing season passes? Use Arrival to capture photos of guests or obtain signatures for waivers.
Which of your booking systems can’t capture waivers, child registration, rental profiles, and photo? Consider how Arrival can be set up to capture this data prior to these guests' arrival. (e.g., Lodging guests that need to fill out waivers for their package ski products.)
Are there steps you can remove from online check-out flows in favor of capturing this information in a pre-arrival flow instead? Making checkout faster and easier helps conversion rates.
Do you want guests to “review” data they entered prior to their arrival? (e.g., Do they need to confirm their rental profile or child registration profile?)
How far in advance of the product date do you want to follow up with guests to complete arrival information?
What will be your default location? Although not required, Aspenware highly recommends your default location be set up with the transaction-driven configuration.
Activities Overview
Once a determination has been made about what the configurations will be and which Locations will be set up for Arrival, map activities to locations. For transaction-driven flows, create a single activity configured with many tasks and map it to the online location (i.e. POS Transactions Location). In this flow, tasks associated with that Activity will only be triggered if the guest has an order that requires those tasks to be completed or confirmed AND they are missing the information on their profile or a member of their household’s profile.
Tasks Overview
As part of determining Arrival configurations, your Aspenware Representative will work with you to define how the following tasks will be folded into your Arrival Strategy and mapped to your various Locations and Activities.
Photo Upload
Child Registration Profile
Rental Profile
Waivers
POS Tasks
Arrival was developed to determine which tasks a guest needs to complete based on standard
RTP|One
product component configuration. Aspenware developed a custom order and transaction query that searches
RTP|One
for upcoming orders and transactions associated with the guest's
RTP|One
customer record. Outstanding tasks that still need to be completed will be eligible for completion in Arrival. However, the guest can only complete these tasks if they navigate to an Arrival location that also has the task configured. See
Detailed Setup
below for detailed steps to configure this in Arrival Admin. Work with your Aspenware Representative in order to install these four custom stored procedures in your
RTP|One
and
RTP|One
TEST databases. The following stored procedures must be created in both Test and Production databases to query orders and transactions and enable Arrival reporting to function:
AW_proc_publicGetArrivalsChildRegistrationValidationByIPCode
AW_proc_publicGetArrivalsImageAndPrintableMediaByIPCode
AW_proc_publicGetArrivalsRentalProfileValidationByIPCode
AW_proc_publicGetCustomerAuthorizationValidationByIPCode
When determining which products will be utilizing Arrival, review your
RTP|One
waiver and product configuration.
Ensure your fulfillment business rules align with the state the Arrival API expects orders to be in to drive various behavior.
For orders to be in a state where they can be “checked-in” (i.e. to have guests complete waivers and profiles), they should be open order lines or transaction lines. Posted, canceled, and returned order lines will be omitted.
For orders to be in a state where they can be “picked up” (i.e. a QR code is provided for printing access products), items must be auto-fulfilled or a transaction. Open order lines cannot be printed on either device (Ski Data or Axess PUBs).
Ensure waivers are added to product components. Record the waiver ID and work with your Aspenware Representative to add it to the planning document.
IMPORTANT
: Waiver dates across Commerce, Arrival, and
RTP|One
waiver configuration
MUST
align perfectly to avoid discrepancies around who is in the email export and who has tasks loaded in Arrival. If a guest is emailed that they have tasks to complete, they should also have tasks loaded in Arrival, so this alignment is imperative. The waiver expiration date in Commerce,
RTP|One
, and Arrival need to match, and then the validation date in Arrival and on
RTP|One
waiver setup also needs to match.
If they do not match, it could result in people being emailed that they have a waiver to complete in Arrival when it has actually already been completed. For example, if people who bought their season pass online have signed a waiver set to expire 6/15/22 (the expiration date for the season pass waiver in Commerce), but the Arrival report export calls the validation date on the Waiver configuration for to season pass waiver in
RTP|One
that is set to 10/31/22, everyone who had a waiver signed in the pass purchase flow in Commerce this year valid through 6/15/22 would be returned in the Arrival export showing as needing a signed waiver.
Alignment is imperative
.
Ensure a “Pickup on PUB” rule is created in
RTP|One
to allow media to print at PUBs. Ensure the “Pickup on PUB” rule is added to PHCs in
RTP|One
for which media can be printed at the PUB using the QR code presented in Arrival. See
Configuration: Pickup Boxes (PUBS)
for more information.
Determine if you will require a photo for printing pass media.
The customer
must
have active, unprinted pass media.
Note: Potentially a proc update could remove the unprinted requirement but a request to your Aspenware representative would need to be submitted.
If photo
is
required before a guest can print their media, ensure pass media components OR product component rules are configured with the required image setting when needed.
If photo
is not
required before a guest can print their media, then opt to use the rule on the product component rather than pass media rule. To configure this, you can make a product component rule in
RTP|One
admin where the rule name and keyword is "
IMAGEREQUIRED
" and add that to components where you want to require a photo when they're sold to the guest. This is used if you want to require a photo on a component that is not a pass media component, while on a pass media component you can just check the "Image Required" box.
REQUIRED:
Either the rule “
IMAGEREQUIRED
“ must be set on the component being purchased or the pass media component must have the Image Required setting checked in RTP. Additionally, the customer
must
have active, unprinted pass media. Note, that potentially a proc update could remove the unprinted requirement but a request to your Aspenware representative would need to be submitted.
Ensure your product components require a Rental profile when needed. Aspenware requires that
RTP|One
configuration setup has a product component rule in
RTP|One
admin where the rule name and keyword is "
RENTALPROFILEREQUIRED
".
Ensure your product components require a Child Registration profile when needed. Aspenware requires that
RTP|One
configuration setup has a product component rule in
RTP|One
admin where the rule name and keyword is "
CHILDREGPROFILEREQUIRED
".
Infrastructure Tasks
Work with your Aspenware Representative to implement Identity and to create the Azure application services required for Arrival.
Detailed Arrival Setup Guide
The following steps will need to be completed in Arrival Administration. To access Arrival Administration, simply go to <arrival.yourresort.com>/admin. If you do not have Admin access, contact your Aspenware Representative at
support@aspenware.com
to be set up as an admin.
Set Up Task Type

1. Set Up Task Type
Arrival comes pre-configured with task types. However, you can determine the validity duration for each of the task types (child registration, rental profile, and photo upload) You can configure how new (based on UpdateDate in
RTP|One
) a profile must be in order for Arrival to recognize that the task has already been completed.
Navigate to
Arrival Admin > Task Types.
Select the task you’d like to update.
Enter the
Effective Days
value. Configure this setting for Rental Profile, Child Registration Profile, and for Photo. If you set “Rental Profile” to 365 days for example, a guest will not have to complete a rental profile if they already have one that is less than 365 days old. But they will be given the option to update their profile if they wish.
Open image-20201026-141435.png
NOTE
: The
Effective Days
setting is currently only used for
Rental Profile
,
Child Registrastion Profile
, and
Photo
tasks. This setting is not used for the waiver task type and should not be configured. Logic for whether a waiver shows to a guest within Arrival uses effective and expiration dates of Authorization profiles on the guest’s profile and the validation date (more details below on this setting below) to key off whether a waiver is required.
2. Set Up Tasks
Start by configuring Tasks which will later be mapped to Activities. Activities will then be mapped to Locations.
Navigate to the
Tasks
tab in Arrival Admin.
To create a new task, do not check any of the existing tasks in the list and configure a new task by adding the following fields in the
Add New Task
area:
Name:
This is the task name that will display to guests on the site.
Minimum Age:
Optionally limit guests who should be prompted to complete this task based on their age. This defines the youngest age a guest could be to be prompted to complete this task if configured.
Maximum Age:
Optionally limit guests who should be prompted to complete this task based on their age. This defines the oldest age a guest could be to be prompted to complete this task if configured.
Is Optional
: Toggle FALSE to make this task required. For example, in an online location using the transaction-driven flow, you may want to set a task to optional since all guests may not be present when the head of household is checking in. For a physical location using the location-driven flow, you may want to set a task to required since all guests will need to complete the task prior to starting their activity.
Task Type
: Choose from the four available task types (Waiver, Rental Profile, Photo, Child Registration)
If
Task Type= Waiver
, enter the following:
POS Waiver ID:
Enter the corresponding authorization code from
RTP|One
.
External Waiver ID
: This field is for
1Risk
waivers only. See
1Risk Waivers for Arrival
for more information about this feature.
If not using a
1Risk
waiver, leave the field blank.
If using a
1Risk
waiver, input the 1RiskID of the waiver provided by
1Risk.
Select to Consolidate Waiver:
If activated, each required waiver will show in a consolidated view, so the logged-in user will be able to sign all waivers for all members in their family that require
that specific
waiver at one time.  If there are any waivers that are not eligible for consolidation, those waivers will be presented for each member to sign separately.
One Day Waiver:
If toggled on, this setting will always use the current date to determine validity. Arrival will check
RTP|One
for a corresponding authorization record. If one exists, Arrival will check if today’s date falls between the start and expiration dates of the waiver for that customer for that waiver in
RTP|One
. This setting should be used if the
RTP|One
product sets
RTP
waivers to be the product date as the start and expiration dates. This is a way to require a new waiver be signed for each product date. If used, the validation date setup should match
RTP|One
authorization setup for the corresponding waiver.
If outside of the date range, Arrival will determine the guest does not have a valid waiver and will prompt the guest to sign a new waiver.
If inside the date range, Arrival will determine the guest does have a valid waiver, and will not prompt the guest to sign a new waiver.
IMPORTANT
: Ensure there is not a mismatch of Validation Date configuration across Arrival and
RTP|One
Authorization configuration. A mismatch could result in guests being emailed that they have a waiver to complete that they have already signed or vice versa.
Effective Date:
This sets the start effective date for the waiver in
RTP|One
. The date the signed waiver is effective.
IMPORTANT
: Ensure there is not a mismatch of Start Effective Date configuration across Arrival,
RTP|One
Authorization configuration, and Commerce waiver configuration.
Expiration Date:
This sets the expiration date for the waiver in
RTP|One
. The date the signed waiver is effective until.
IMPORTANT
: Ensure there is not a mismatch of Expiration Date configuration across Arrival,
RTP|One
Authorization configuration, and Commerce waiver configuration.
Validation Date
:  This date is used to determine validity.
Arrival will check
RTP|One
for a corresponding authorization record. If one exists, Arrival will check if the Validation date set in Arrival falls between the start and expiration dates of the waiver for that customer for that waiver in
RTP|One
.
If outside of the date range, Arrival will determine the guest does not have a valid waiver and prompt the guest to sign a new waiver.
If inside the date range, Arrival will determine the guest does have a valid waiver, and will not prompt the guest to sign a new waiver.
This field should be left blank if you toggle “One Day Waiver” on.
Often resorts will set the validation date as the same as the "expiration date" for season-long waivers.
IMPORTANT
: Ensure there is not a mismatch of Validation Date configuration across Arrival and RTP|One Authorization configuration. A mismatch could result in guests being emailed that they have a waiver to complete that they have already signed or vice versa. The arrival export, determines the list of guests to email that has unsigned waivers to complete keys off the validation date set up on the waiver in
RTP|One
, while Arrival determines whether a waiver task is needed for a guest once they login to Arrival based on the validation date configured on the waiver task in Arrival.
Signer validation:
At least one of the following must be configured, but can more than one or all can be set.
Enable Agree Checkbox
: If checked, the guest will need to check to agree to the waiver, and will be stored in
RTP|One
that the guest checked to agree to the waiver.
Enable Text Signature:
If checked, the guest will need to type the name of the signed-in user, and it will be stored in
RTP|One
that the guest typed X name to agree to the waiver.
Enable Wet Signature:
If checked, the guest can “ink” their signature, and the image of the signature will be stored in
RTP|One
.
NOTE: This option requires RTP2016 or later.
Custom Comment:
This field gives the option to populate the comment box in
RTP|One
’s Authorization profile. Can be used with tokens {Signer}, {SignedDate}, {BrowserName}, {BrowserVersion} to provide who signed, on what date, with what browser, and what browser version.
For waivers, the exact HTML that a guest sees through Arrival will be saved in the profile text in the authorization record in RTP|One.
Select
UPDATE TASK
when complete.

3. Set Up Activities
Once Tasks are set up, Activities are used to assign one or more Tasks to an Activity.
Create a New Activity
Navigate to the
Activities
tab in Arrival Admin.
To create a new activity, do not check any of the existing Activities in the list and configure a new activity by adding the following fields in the
Add New Activity
area:
Name
: The name input here will be displayed to guests so they know which activity they are completing.
Age Min
: (Optional) Adding a minimum age restricts which guests can be selected to check in for this specific Activity. If a guest is younger than the specified age, then they cannot be selected on the Activity page and will be unable to complete any Tasks associated with the Activity.
Age Max
: (Optional) Adding a maximum age restricts which guests can be selected to check in for this specific Activity. If a guest is older than the specified age, then they cannot be selected on the Activity page and will be unable to complete any Tasks associated with the Activity.
Image Url
: The URL for the image that will appear on the Activity page in conjunction with the Activity. Recommended dimensions are at least
1400x900
but must be under
270KB
in file size.
Click the ADD ACTIVITY and scroll up to the
Activity List
to find the newly created Activity to edit/add Tasks.
Open image-20201020-192357.png
Add Tasks to a New Activity
Go to the
Activities
tab in Arrival Admin.
In the
Activities List
section, click the checkbox next to the desired Activity
.
Scroll down to the
Link Tasks
section.
Choose a Task
:
Click here and select a Task to add to this Activity.
Click
LINK TASK
to add the selected task to the Activity.
Multiple tasks can be added via the steps above, or a task can be removed here by clicking the red trash can icon next to the task.
IMPORTANT
: If you are creating an activity that will be added to a transaction-based location, ensure that all the tasks you would like to prompt guests to complete in Arrival based on their transactions are added to the Activity. Though there may be many tasks configured within the activity, guests going through the transaction-based flow would only be prompted to fill out specific tasks that they are personally missing based on their orders in
RTP|One
.
Open image-20201020-192641.png
4. Set Up Location(s)
Once you have completed Task and Activity configuration, you are ready to configure Locations.
Go to the
Locations
tab in Arrival Admin.
To create a new location, do not check any of the existing locations in the list and configure a new location by adding the following fields in the
Add New Location
area:
Location Name:
This name will display to guests on the site. This name will also be included in the directory within the URL. A '-' will substitute any space in the location name. (e.g. If the location name is Ski School the url will be
http://arrival.yourresort.com/ski-school
)
Description:
This is
used for internal organization. This description will not display to guests.
Is Enabled
: This is equivalent to “publishing” the location. When selected, guests will be able to navigate to the Location URL.
Is Default:
When selected, this location will be your default location.
IMPORTANT
: Only one Location can be configured as the default Location. This is the location that will be loaded for /home.
Is Edit Profile Location:
When this is selected, this Location will be your “Edit Profile” location. This Location is designed to allow guests to update tasks they have already completed. For example, you can configure rental profiles and child registration tasks at this Location to allow guests to update these profiles even after they have valid profiles. Guests will have the option to navigate to this “Edit Profile” Location after completing check-in from a Location using the POS transaction-driven configuration.
NOTE
: This configuration is optional for your resort. A max of one Location can be configured as the Edit Profile location.
On the POS location URL, the edit profile button will only appear once all “POS” tasks displayed have been completed for all family members.
Use POS Transactions (RTP):
When this is selected, this Location will function based on
RTP|One
orders and transactions, driving tasks off of incomplete steps for orders for the household in
RTP|One
. If unselected, this Location will follow the location-driven configuration outlined in the
Locations Overview
section of this document above.
Check in Complete Text:
This is the messaging the guest will see once the guest has completed all required steps for this Location.
NOTE:
HTML is supported, but should be limited to the standard text where possible (H1, H2, H3, P, UL, LI). While image tags are supported, special precautions should be taken to avoid breaking the responsive nature of the site across devices.
Default Activity:
The default activity is the activity used to create check-in tasks for this particular Location. For a POS transaction location, only tasks that are added to this default activity will be presented to the user, even if
RTP|One
is indicating that additional info is required. For example: If
RTP|One
is indicating that the guest requires waiver #999 but that waiver is not created as a task and assigned to the default activity, the user will not be asked to sign the waiver in Arrival.
POS Transaction (transaction-driven) Location: Only the default activity is used for check-in at this time. In a future version, additional linked activities can be used to generate tasks and the order of assigned activities does not matter. Regardless, one must be selected as default for Arrival to function properly.
Non-POS (location-driven) Location: Only the default activity is used for check-in at this time. All other linked activities are ignored. In the future, all Locations will offer guests the ability to check in for one or more activities.
Assign Activities:
The default activity must also be assigned to the Location.
Select your Location and in the column on the right, select the drop-down under
Link Activities
.
Select the Activity to assign to the Location.
Click
LINK ACTIVITY
.
Future versions of Arrival will support multiple Activities per location.
Once complete, select
UPDATE LOCATION

8. Update Arrival Settings
Go to the
General Tab
to set up Arrival site-wide settings. The following can be edited:
Display External Order ID as QR Code:
This is used to display a QR code to the guest on the home page of any POS transaction location.
Deselecting this will set the
RTP|One
IP code as the QR code.
Selecting this will set the QR code on the arrival screen to the External Order ID. Presently this is required for resorts using
SkiData for Skiosk PUBs.
NOTE
: Guests who did not purchase through the online sales channel will not have a QR code to display as one does not exist.
Google analytics tag id:
Input your GTM code here to track Arrival actions via GA. The ID must start with "GTM". While this GTM ID does need to be updated, you will also need to configure your Google Tag Manager environment to match the documented guidelines for how to set up tags, triggers, and variables to actually track data.
Login - Aspenware Customer Hub
Resort codes:
Optional. This can be entered to filter Arrival’s order/transaction search in
RTP|One
. This can be useful if
RTP|One
is shared amongst several resorts or if there is a need to filter out specific orders/transactions. The Value input is the
RTP|One
’s Business Unit (resort) settings.
Resort group codes
:
Optional for the same uses as resort codes. The Value input is
RTP|One
's Business Group.
Sales locations ids
:
Optional for the same uses as resort codes. The Value input is
RTP|One
's Location ID.
Pass Check POS Location Id
: Refer to the
Login - Aspenware Customer Hub
for details on configuring Pass Checker in Arrival. This setting serves as a default lift or access point that passes will be validated against in the instance that additional “accesslocations” are not defined within the “Collections” admin area.
8. Configure Export List of Eligible Customers for Email (Optional)
Arrival offers the ability to generate a list of customers that are eligible to check-in on Arrival. This is designed to be able to be generated once daily at a planned time and can be used to generate email lists for external email and CRM systems to send notifications to guests, either via manual list uploads or through our API integration if your CRM supports the Arrival API integration.
NOTE
: Aspenware will not be providing the capability to actually send these emails.
Generally, the overnight export will use the same logic as the Order and Transaction API described in the
POS Tasks
section above. If the guest has tasks to complete in Arrival, they will appear on this list. The API will provide a file of all the guests who have items to check in and/or media to print. This file will be generated on a schedule overnight so as to reduce processing overhead when the API itself is called.
The core API parameters will be
Days Before
and
Days After
and an array of sale location codes (no IPCodes).
If the
Days After
is set to 5, meaning that guests should be checked in for products with a start date (product) up to 5 days in the future, this means they will appear on the export 5 days prior to their start date.
If a guest does not complete their arrival tasks 5 days prior to the start date, they will also appear on the export 4 days prior, 3 days prior, etc. until their tasks are completed. It will be up to the CRM/Email system to prevent sending emails to the same guest too often.
IMPORTANT
: A guest with a non-date based product will be returned in the export if
RTP|One
needs that task completed and the Arrival POS Location has a matching task.
Because the list is pre-processed, any changes in the list that happen after it is generated will not be accounted for throughout the day. For example, if the file is generated at 5am and emails are sent out at 5:30am, it is possible that a guest’s tasks to complete or media to pick up may have changed either due to them completing those tasks or something changing in
RTP|One
like a transaction being returned.
NOTE
: For a detailed explanation of the Arrival export logic, please see
Arrival Export Logic Explained
.
9. Configure Reporting Tab (Optional)
The
Reporting
tab is used to export a csv or json file that generates guest information from
RTP|One
to be used for emailing guests with missing profile information needed prior to their activity start.
The data for this report is downloaded from
RTP|One
once daily at 5:00AM resort’s local time but the Aspenware Team can update this defaulted time upon request. You can see on the
Reporting
tab the last time the report was run.
Once downloaded the list can be used with your CRM to decide how and when to contact guests via email distribution. Continue reading below for details on what the configuration in the Reporting tab achieves. You’ll also find examples with descriptions of what is included in the standard report and details report.
Location
: This dropdown displays all of your active
POS
Locations in Arrival. You can only select one Location at a time and when you download a report only guests with both an outstanding task in
RTP|One
and with a matching task assigned to this location will be included in the report.
Begin Date:
Defines the starting date the report will generate information based on the start date of an order/transaction in
RTP|One
. A max of 5 months in the past can be selected.
End Date
: Defines the ending date the report will generate information based on the start date of an order/transaction in
RTP|One
. Any date in the future can be selected.
NOTE
: A guest with a non-date-based product will be returned here if
RTP|One
requires that task for completion and the Arrival POS Location has a matching task.
Include Printable media:
Selecting this will have the report include information for guests that have a printable media product purchased and has not yet been printed in
RTP|One
. Once logged in to Arrival, guests will see a QR code on their account that can be scanned at PUBs for printing.
Deselecting this will omit guests who only have outstanding printable media and will only generate information on guests who have outstanding tasks based on the POS Location and date range selected.
Includes Details:
Deselecting this will generate a Standard Report and selecting this will generate a Detailed Report.
Standard Report
: Attached below is an example of Arrival’s standard report with descriptions of the data each column is generating. It is recommended to use this report as the distribution list to send to customers. Displays the head of household’s contact details if the head of household or anyone in the household in
RTP|One
requires a task to be completed with a matching task at this Arrival Location.
Details Report
: Attached below is an example of Arrival’s Details Report with descriptions of the data each column is generating. It is recommended to use this report for data validation and not as a distribution list to send to guests. Displays the head of household’s contact details AND the household participant’s details if the head of household or household in
RTP|One
requires a task to be completed with a matching task at this Arrival Location.

CSV Export:
Selecting this will generate the report in CSV formatting. Deselecting this will generate the report in json formatting.
Test Customer Activities
: This is primarily used as a validation tool, inputting a guest’s IP code from
RTP|One
will return information on their outstanding tasks in json formatting.
IMPORTANT
: A guest with a non-date-based product will be returned in the export if
RTP|One
needs that task completed and the Arrival POS Location has a matching task).
10. Configure API Tab
Arrival’s API tab is used to export guest information from
RTP|One
to your CRM tool and the API is available to any CRM that develops the capability to call the data. Your CRM does not need to log in to Arrival as guest information is secured through an API key that can be provided to them. Once the CRM has access to the API, the CRM can configure specific parameters they call on; simply put: the CRM is able to import the guest information for the exact guests that should be emailed for Arrival tasks
IF
they have this specified. If they do not have anything specified when they make the API call, they receive Arrival’s default parameters; default parameters are set on Arrival’s API screen and described in this article section below.
NOTE
: The data available through the API is obtained through the same method as the
Reporting
tab. It is downloaded from
RTP|One
once daily at 5:00AM resort’s local time but the Apenware Team can update this defaulted time upon request. Once downloaded, the list can be used with your CRM to decide how and when to contact guests via email distribution.
API Access Keys
: In order for a CRM to obtain guest information, you must provide them with an API key from this list. Copy and paste existing API keys to share with your CRM(s). If you click the red trash can icon, this will delete an existing API and would break any established connections your CRM has through that key.
Create API Token:
This generates a unique API key to call the data Arrival has obtained from
RTP|One
. You can create multiple API keys if you need to share with multiple systems and want to keep the keys unique. To create an API Key:
Click
CREATE API TOKEN
.
Input a
Token Nickname
: ie: {CRM Name}
Click
CREATE TOKEN
.
API Default Settings
: This is the defaulted information a CRM will obtain when they call the API IF the CRM has not specified specific parameters. The two sections here function the same as the Reporting Tab’s “Begin Date” and “End Date”.
Days Before Current Day
: Defines the starting date the report will generate information based on the start date (product date) of an order/transaction in
RTP|One
. A max of 5 months in the past can be selected.
Days After Current Day
: Defines the ending date the report will generate information based on the start date (product) of an order/transaction in
RTP|One
. Any date in the future can be selected.
IMPORTANT
: A guest with a non-date-based product will be returned in the results if
RTP|One
needs that task completed and the Arrival POS Location has a matching task.
After you have updated these two fields click
UPDATE DEFAULT SETTINGS
and if your CRM has not specified these parameters, the next time they call on Arrival’s API they will receive guest information based on this date range.
Available API Endpoints & Documentation
: This section describes information on how to call the API and the parameters that can be specified.
11. Ensure Arrival QR Codes Are Aligned With Pick up Box Approach
QR codes will be displayed in Arrival for guests to use to pick up media at either an
Axess
PUB or
Skidata
Skiosk. Printing media requires that line items are auto-fulfilled. Open Order lines cannot be printed on either device.
Axess PUB Approach:
Arrival will display a QR Code of each family member’s IPCodes, which will be able to be scanned at the PUB for pass media pickup. Only family members with pass media to pickup will be displayed in Arrival.
QR Codes will only display if:
Pass Media is in an
RTP|One
Sales Transaction (either directly or as part of auto-fulfilled order line);
The media Product Header in
RTP|One
has “
Axess Print on PUB
” rule added;
Pass Media is not returned;
Guest has an image - only if it is required by the Pass Media;
Guest has completed all required waivers associated to the transaction line; and
Pass Media has not already been printed.
Note
: Ensure the “General” Tab settings “Display External Order ID as QR Code“ is aligned with the PUB type in use at the resort:
For resorts using Axess PUBs, either the ExternalOrderID or IPCode can be used.
For resorts using Skidata Skiosks, ExternalOrderID must be used.
Skidata Skiosk Approach:
Arrival will display QR Codes of
RTP|One
External Order IDs that are associated with family members who have media to pick up. (Skiosk does not support IPCodes or any other
RTP|One
values.)
This will print any media in the order (even if for members outside of the family).
QRCodes will only display if:
Pass Media is in an
RTP|One
Sales Transaction (must be fulfilled or auto-fulfilled from an Order with an External Order ID);
Product Header in
RTP|One
has “
SkiData Print on PUB
” rule added;
Pass Media is not returned;
Guest has an image - only if it is required by the Pass Media;
Guest has completed all required waivers associated to the transaction line; and
Pass Media has not already been printed.
Note
: Ensure the “General” Tab settings “Display External Order ID as QR Code“ is aligned with the PUB type in use at the resort.
12. Configure Collections Tab
This is leveraged with the Arrival Pass Checker Functionality and is fully detailed in the
Pass Checker Configuration guide
.
13. Set Up Custom Analytics (Optional)
A series of customer events are triggered when a guest takes an action. Each action is registered as a single arrival_event and split out according to the task performed. This enables a record of each action taken by a user allowing the resort to collect and analyze information. Custom events show resorts exactly how many times an event was performed on the application providing powerful data that can be leveraged to best serve your customers and improve the user experience. Data can be seen via Google Analytics (legacy or the latest version 4). Following is a list of custom events and a snapshot of an example Google Analytics dashboard below.

Q: A guest is receiving an email to complete tasks that they have already completed.
Q: Why are guests being emailed that they have a waiver to complete that they have already signed?
A: Ensure there is not a mis-match of Validation Date configuration across Arrival and
RTP|One
Authorization configuration. A mismatch could result in guests being emailed that they have a waiver to complete that they have already signed, or vice versa. The arrival export, which determines the list of guests to email who have unsigned waivers to complete keys off the validation date set up on the waiver in
RTP|One
, while Arrival determines whether a waiver task is needed for a guest once they login to Arrival based on the validation date configured on the waiver task in Arrival. These
MUST
be aligned.
Q: A guest is receiving an email to complete tasks that they have already completed.
A: Because the email list is pre-processed, any changes in the list that happen after it is generated will not be accounted for throughout the day. For example, if the file is generated at 5am and emails are sent out at 5:30am, it is possible that a guest’s tasks to complete or media to pick up may have changed either due to them completing those tasks or something changing in
RTP|One
like a transaction being returned.

Auto-hotlisting
is a feature that enables resorts to restrict lift access by pass media code for guests who do not have a valid liability waiver. As part of the sale of a product that requires a liability waiver, Aspenware provides the ability to flag
pass media codes
that are in need of a valid authorization profile in RTP. Then, once the waiver is signed through Aspenware’s Resort Tools, Arrival or Commerce platform, hotlisting is removed and the guest may access the lift.
This feature is available for resorts that have purchased Arrival or Resort Tools and use RTP as their point-of-sale system.
When Should I Use This Feature?
This feature should be used if you want to restrict guests who do not have valid liability waivers on file from accessing their media-accessible activity.
Prerequisites
Ensure that products are configured as they normally would in RTP by attaching Authorization Types to product components.  Typically Authorization Types are added to Access components in
RTP|One
.
Configuration Guide
You will need to work with your Aspenware Service Agent to implement this feature.
1. Complete the questionnaire
To begin setup of this feature, determine the answers to the following questions and submit them to your  Service Agent (
support@aspenware.com):
Is Authorization on Acess or Pass Media Components?
Do you want to add hotlisting to day products, season-long products, or both?
What is the Authorization Type code(s) you’d like to hotlist?
What is the Authorization Expiration Date?
What is the Hotlist date(s)?
What are the Access Hotlist code(s)?
2. Configure Setup Table (Aspenware)
Aspenware will set up a table in which RTP Authorization Type codes are mapped to an Access Hotlist code and a stored procedure is then scheduled to run every X minutes.
3. C
ustomize Stored Procedure (Optional - Aspenware)
As an option, we can customize the RTP stored procedure,
proc_publicGetCustomerAuthorizationValidation
to prevent the RTP authorization window from popping up when completing an RTP transaction. This can be configured by RTP Client Code which allows you to define which clients should continue showing the RTP Authorization pop-up and which clients should not display it

Aspenware Arrival helps bridge the technological gap in the ski industry by bringing proven mechanics inspired from Airline check-in. Arrival’s ample configuration options provide a platform that encourages creativity, which will continue to grow as more features are added. Even if your resort sells exclusively through an eCommerce channel that requires the guest to complete all product requirements, you’ll see benefits from the Arrival application. Aspenware worked closely with resort partners to flush out use cases for the Arrival application, which are outlined in this document.
Open image-20201030-040042.png
Edit Profile
- Your resort can configure a location for updating profiles that were previously filled out online. This includes rental and child reg profiles.
Simplify Ecommerce to increase conversions
- Your resort can remove child registration and rental profile from Ecommerce flows and collect them later using Arrival. This can help increase your conversion rates.
Orders not placed in Ecommerce
- Your resort can utilize Arrival for orders not placed online. You can require guests to collect info before arrival for products purchased through these channels (i.e. call center orders, Inntopia orders).
Walk-up guests
- Your resort can display QR codes on site that guests can use to navigate to Arrival. Guests can complete tasks before they reach sales agents, thus streamlining the process.
Sending QR codes
- Your resort can send guests links to Arrival to pull up QR codes closer to their trip. This helps guests by reducing the number of emails they have to dig through. Emails can also remind guests that they can use PUBs to print their media.
Verify Emergency Contacts
- Guests can confirm child registration profiles prior to lesson drop-off to verify that emergency contacts in child registration profiles are approved to pick up the child post-lesson.
Covid health check waivers
- If your resort requires these waivers, you can set up a special Covid waiver location with an authorization type that is required every day.
Lift ticket window purchases -
You can provide a QR code onsite to help guests get started with their purchase. Guests will be directed to an Arrival URL focused on Lift Tickets, providing a singl waiver sign task. Guests will have the option to add family members who are also purchasing tickets. The entire family can check-in and sign the waivers. By the time they get to the window, all members of the family are created with valid birthdates, all waivers are signed, and the sales agent can quickly assign purchases in RTP.
Season pass office
-
When an employee at the pass office determines a guest has to sign a waiver, they can direct the guest to a QR code displayed at the stand for the guest to sign the waiver on their phone, including any family members.
RTP|One
is updated in real-time as the guest completes their waiver(s). This can also be used to capture a guests photo.
Hotel concierge
-
Hotels can offer guidance including printed material with an easy way to make sure guests are ready for their activities the following day. The QR codes included in the material can take the guest straight to check-in tasks based on purchases the guest has previously made.
Hot-listed media at the lift
- You can hotlist media of guests who have outstanding waivers. Gate staff/lift attendants can be equipped with an iPad or QR code to give to a guest if they discover their media is hot-listed due to a missing waiver. The guest can step out of line momentarily, sign all their waivers on their phone and proceed through the gate.
Products that may not require a purchase
-
You may offer an activity that requires a waiver but not a purchase. For example, free babysitting or a kid’s movie night. Guests can scan the code and sign a waiver without a corresponding purchase/transaction. Couple this with a child registration and parents can go on their way.
Rental equipment tuning/tech station
- If the guest brings their skis in for adjustment – whether rentals or personal equipment – you can require the guest to fill out a rental profile at the tech station and sign the appropriate waiver.

Airline passengers have been programmed to check-in 24 hours prior to their flights for years now. This allows the airline to capture information on the guest, saves time at the airport, and gives travelers peace of mind that their experience at the airport will be smooth. Aspenware Arrival provides this experience for guests coming to ski and ride at the resort. Guests can check in prior to arriving at the resort.

Resort Tools reduces time spent waiting in line for guests and time spent by resort staff checking guests in across your resort.
Overview
Resort Tools encompasses two products that can be used in one of two ways or in tandem for the optimal onsite guest experience. The two offerings are as follows:
Resort Tools - Kiosk
Resort Tools - Kiosk
is designed for guests to complete the required information at a resort kiosk Our user-facing kiosk is designed to capture required information in your rental stores, pass offices and lesson locations. The streamlined user flow is designed for ease of use and accurate customer profiles. Resorts mitigate risk with the careful completion and collection of required documents.
All guests at a particular location will be guided through the same process, which is optimized for that location. The product can operate without an internet connection if configured for offline use. Guests can use a fast-flow option with pre-filled information, but personalization based on guest data and order details is unavailable. If personalization is important,
Aspenware Arrival
may be a better option. To use Resort Tools - Kiosk, a Resort Tools or Aspenware Arrival license is required.

Resort Tools - Waiver Tablets (Guest Check-In)
Resort Tools - Waiver Tablets (Guest Check-In) enables guests to complete required information onsite. This tool enables the signing of waivers, the ability to email waivers to non-present attendees, the option to opt into marketing communications, and the ability to capture and upload a photo.

Self-Registration software enables resorts to set up Kiosks where guests can complete child registration tasks, emergency contact information, rental profile tasks, and print relevant guest details (such as rental info) from the IIS server.
This feature is supported for:
Resorts that use
RTP|One
as a POS and have a license for Aspenware Arrival and/or Resort Tools.
This feature is not supported for:
Resorts that use
Siriusware
as a POS.
Feature Description
Resort Tools Self Registration Kiosk
is most commonly used at Rental Shops, Ski School, and the Pass Office, however, it can be used at any mountain products sales location that has an
RTP|One
POS. This typically replaces customer signin at the rental shop, is used in ski schools for capturing waivers, child registration information, and rental profile, and is often used in pass offices for waiver capture.
Resorts can set up branded kiosks that are designed to be used on touchscreen monitors with peripherals.  Fast Flow can be turned on for guests who completed their orders online or in advance. An order number will display for a guest who’s activity date is within 5 days according to the following logic:
The guest’s order exists at the Rental Location configured in Admin and the order is +/- 5-days into the future or past
The guest has a Rental order at any location +/- 5-days
The guest has any order +/- 5-days
Resorts can kiosks be set up at different locations across the mountain with unique configurations per location (or per kiosk). It is highly configurable and can include unique flows, content, and images for each location to facilitate a faster check-in flow without requiring staff assistance. Tasks for kiosk check-in can be ordered or removed to the resort’s preference and include:
Collecting emergency contact details
Completing child registration profiles
Completing rental profile (and optionally selecting the damage waiver)
Signing waivers
Printing guest details from IIS (anything that can be printed from IIS can be included on the print-out)
Regardless of the tasks chosen for a kiosk, the first step every guest will step through is locating or creating an account for registration.

Authenticated & Logout
To increase security,
a resort staff member is required to login prior to opening up
each terminal to the guests. There will be two credentials shared with the resort: ‘admin’ and ‘user.'  To configure Resort Tools, you will login with your admin credentials, and to enable guests to use Resort Tools, you will login with your ‘user’ credentials.
Each terminal must be logged into separately and the session by default will last for 180 days.
Upon upgrade and first sign in, the ‘clock’ will start for your 180 day session.  We recommend that the Resort logout and log back in prior to the time expiring to ensure that there is no down time once the login expires on day 180.
Credentials will be generated upon deployments from v3.8 onwards.  Those credentials will be given to the Resort in a secure method directly after from Aspenware.  If credentials are forgotten, the Resort must submit a ticket to Aspenware to resend those credentials.
If credentials are compromised, the same must happen, but Aspenware will generate new credentials for the Resort.
This will require Aspenware to re-deploy Resort Tools.  This will NOT require a new sign in if you were signed in previously; however, the Resort is advised to sign out if the credentials are compromised.

Configure unique 3 or 4 - digit RTP Client Codes for each kiosk in
RTP|One
as they will be added to Resort Tools - Kiosk at a later step.
2. Configure authorization type(s) (Optional)
If Self-Registration will include the waiver signing step then

’s Authorization Type must be set to active and the Authorization Text field must be populated with the waiver HTML code. All steps required for a full authorization type configuration per
RTP|One
documentation is recommended.
Infrastructure Tasks

2. Select database to be used for Aspenware Resort Tools - Kiosk (
RTP|One
database or a separate ResortTools database)
Aspenware requires adding new tables and stored procedures for Resort Tools - Kiosk. This can be added to the
RTP|One
Db or a new Db (ie: ResortTools). Both options work but some resorts do not want anything non-RTP related added to the
RTP|One
Db and choose to have Aspenware create a new ResortTools Db. Aspenware will create a new SQL role and user for use with  Resort Tools - Kiosk.
3. Provide Aspenware access to VPN
(if applicable)
If RDP access is restricted to access through a VPN then provide Aspenware Representative with credentials to obtain access.
4. Provide Aspenware access to RDP
Provide credentials to access the RDP that will host Resort Tools - Kiosk. Aspenware’s credentials will need read and write permissions.
5. Provide Server details that will host Resort Tools - Kiosk
Aspenware requires Resort Tools - Kiosk to be installed on a server that is
not
the Unity server. However, the hosting server needs to be able to communicate to the Unity server using the Unity URL (ie:
https://servername.com/UnityProd/index.html
) and also needs to be able to communicate to the RTP Db Server.
NOTE
: Resort Tools - Kiosk server should not be in the DMZ and should be in LAN.
6. Install Google Chrome on the hosting server
Aspenware requires Google Chrome to be installed on the hosting server to enable testing.
7. Install Resort Tools - Kiosk (To be completed by Aspenware)
Once the steps above are complete Aspenware will install Resort Tools - Kiosk and required files based on RTP’s Server install guide and dotnet-hosting-2.2.7-win.
8. Enable intranet access for Kiosks
Self-Registration Kiosks must be able to access the internal network. If using fonts hosted online, kiosks must also have internet access.
9. Login as ‘User’
Once all required steps are completed, the Resort staff can then login with the credentials provided during the ‘pre-requisite’ task.
IMPORTANT:
Credentials are required to access Resort Tools after Version 3.8. Please contact your
Aspenware Customer Success Specialist
to obtain these.
Please note:
The sign-in session will last for 180 days by default, after which the Resort will need to sign in again on the terminal.
Each terminal must be signed in separately for guest access.
10. Complete printer setup (optional)
Printer(s) should be on the same network as Resort Tools - Kiosk and the printer drivers must be installed directly onto the hosting server. The local driver then must be mapped to the hosting server driver.
NOTE:
One way to test setup is to open Notepad on the hosting server, type a random note, and select to print. It should be able to output to the printer(s).
12. Configure .RDL for printing (optional)
Self-Registration can print output upon self-registration task completion (ie: the most common printing output is a rental form). Aspenware will provide an example .RDL with all the supported fields that can print.
13. Set Up custom Resort Tools - Kiosk URL (optional)
By default, the server IP address or server name is used. If the resort would prefer to set up a custom URL the resort can do so.
Resort Tools - Kiosk Admin Tasks
Determinations must be made about the following items to customize for your resort.
1. Determine Kiosk Requirements

.
2. Add Location(s) and input Location settings
Go to Resort Tools - Kiosk Admin >
Self Registration
>
Settings
> click
Add
under Locations then complete the following:
Location ID
: input a name to label the Location in Resort Tools - Kiosk (this is not linked to anything in
RTP|One
)
Location Name
: input the name to be saved for reference in Resort Tools - Kiosk Admin (ie: Resort Name or a location-specific area such as “West Rental Office”)
Print on Complete
: checked will automatically print upon guests completing the rental process. Unchecked will not print.
Default Terminal ID
: Input a valid terminal ID (setting required as a placeholder)
Display Damage Waiver
: Checked will display a checkbox with damage waiver as a selectable option on the Rental Profile step and if the guest selects this and printing is enabled it will show on the printed form. Unchecked will remove the damage waiver from appearing as a selection.
Default Damage Waiver
: Checked will mark the damage waiver as preselected if the damage waiver is enabled. Unchecked will default the damage waiver to unselected if the damage waiver is enabled.
Default Signature Device
: Select “Screen” if utilizing touchscreen monitors. Select “Pad” if utilizing a signature pad.
Require Address for Contact
: Checked will force guests who are creating a new account to enter their address information. Unchecked will not display address information when guests are creating a new account.

If this box is checked, the guest will be presented with a checkbox that is already checked. If this setting is unchecked, the guest will be presented with a checkbox that is unchecked.
What this transfers to RTP:
A “checked” box passes an affirmative response – indicates to RTP that the customer should have a communications profile created, with all profile boxes “unchecked” in the profile, indicating their willingness to receive email communications.
An “Unchecked“ box passes a decline response – indicates to RTP that the customer should have a communication profile created, with the email box “Checked” in the profile, indicating that the guest is not willing to receive email communication.

if reordering is required.
4. Add Terminal(s) to Locations(s)
Go to
Self Registration
>
Locations
> and click
Edit
on the desired location > Scroll down to “TERMINALS” and click
Add
.
The majority of these settings can be set at the Location-level and any changes at the Terminal-level will override the setting for that unique terminal.
Terminal ID
: Enter a new unique Client Code from RTP. This is also used to build the rental form number when using rental forms.
Printer Name
: Printer name must also be configured at the terminal level.  See step 6 above.
Enable RFID Scanning
: Optionally RFID scanning can be enabled at unique terminals
Authorization Code
: Optionally a different Authorization code for waiver signing can be configured at the Terminal level if using a different waiver for specific terminals is desired.
Report Path
: Optionally the report path (which determines what is printed) can be configured at the terminal level if using a different report for specific terminals is desired. Otherwise, the report will be set up at the location level in step 6 above.
Signature Device
: Optionally using the signature pad or screen signing can be enabled at unique terminals.
5. Update Theming
The Resort Tools - Kiosk tool is highly customizable and can be branded to use resort-specific colors, fonts, logos, and background images. The theme can be configured at two different levels. The top-level will cascade down to all created Locations. The second level is the Location level, any updates to settings at this level will override the top-level settings and will cascade down to each terminal in that location.
Go to
Self Registration
>
Style Customization
Refer to the “Gather Branding Materials” above for references on formatting requirements. Once the fields have been updated click
Save
.
IMPORTANT
: The “Save” button at the
bottom
of the page does not always function. It is recommended to use the Save button at the
top

7. Configure Languages (Optional)
Languages can be configured at two different levels. The top-level is at the product as a whole and will cascade down to all created Locations. The second level is the location level, any updates to settings at this level will override the product-wide settings and will cascade down to each terminal in that location.
NOTE
: Languages must be set up at the product level and can optionally be set up at the Location levels.

This guide will review how to set up
1Risk
Waivers in Aspenware Resort Tools. Aspenware currently supports 1Risk Waivers for Self Registration only (and not Guest Check-in). For more information on Resort Tools see
Aspenware Resort Tools Documentation
and for more information on
1Risk
waivers see
1Risk Documentation
. Once you understand general resort tools and
1Risk
waiver setup, follow the guide below for implementation.
Overview
Similar to
1Risk
waivers presented in the Aspenware Commerce checkout flow, in Resort Tools the
1Risk
waiver is presented as an iframe through which the user interacts directly with the
1Risk
waiver. Also like Aspenware Commerce, signed
1Risk
waivers are stored in great detail within the
1Risk
platform while an authorization profile is created for the signing guest in
RTP|One.
Aspenware also offers tokens to store the waiver ID (AuthTypeCode) signer’s name, date, and browser. See below for an example flow.
Open 1Risk Release Guide Images - Frame 5.jpg
Key Terms
Authorization Code (or Auth Type Code)
The Authorization Code is a code set in RTP that is used to categorize the waiver. For the purposes of 1Risk, the code is a reference, as the waiver is presented in the iframe by 1Risk. Before administering waivers in Self Registration refer to the Aspenware
1Risk
waiver documentation
to set up waivers properly and get your waiver url and auth type code.
Custom Comment Tokens
Arrival custom comment tokens allow customer-specific information to be transferred to the custom comment section of the authorization profile. The following custom comment tokens exist for both 1Risk and Aspenware waivers:
{AuthTypeCode} {Signer} {Signed Date} {BrowserName} {BrowserVersion}
View in Aspenware Resort Tools Admin Task tab:
Open Screen Shot 2022-05-25 at 2.04.20 PM.png

Resort Tools Security Recommendations
Sarah Holst
Owned by
Sarah Holst
Last updated:

2 min read
The following security controls are recommended to protect Resort Tools systems and maintain a secure environment for guest operations. These best practices focus on restricting unauthorized access, reducing attack surfaces, and ensuring system resilience. Please note that these security precautions apply to
both
the Resort Tools Kiosks and Resort Tools Waiver Tablets/Guest Check-In.
IP Restriction
Control
: Restrict access to Resort Tools systems to only allowed IP addresses.
Threat/Risk Mitigated
: Unauthorized access attempts from unknown or potentially malicious IP addresses can lead to data breaches or system compromise. IP restriction limits exposure by only allowing access from trusted sources, reducing the risk of unauthorized intrusion.
Firewall and NSG Rules
Control
: Configure firewall and Network Security Group (NSG) rules to allow only necessary traffic.
Threat/Risk Mitigated
: Firewalls and NSGs control both inbound and outbound traffic, blocking any unnecessary or potentially harmful connections. These configurations prevent unauthorized network access and reduce the chances of attacks, such as port scanning and data exfiltration, by restricting the network pathways available to external and internal actors.
Kiosk Mode
Control
: Set Resort Tools devices to operate in kiosk mode, limiting functionality to the required application only.
Threat/Risk Mitigated
: Kiosk mode prevents users from accessing other system features or applications, reducing the risk of accidental misconfigurations or intentional misuse. This control limits the potential for data tampering, unauthorized software installation, and exposure to malicious websites, ensuring the system remains dedicated solely to guest check-in functionality.
Do Not Expose Externally
Control
: Avoid assigning public IP addresses to Resort Tools systems and ensure they are not accessible from the internet.
Threat/Risk Mitigated
: Publicly accessible systems are more vulnerable to attacks, such as brute-force attempts, DDoS, and exposure to vulnerabilities from external sources. By keeping Resort Tools systems internal-only, the risk of exploitation by external attackers is minimized, maintaining a more secure and controlled environment.
SSL Certificate Requirement
Control
: Ensure that SSL certificates are applied to all Resort Tools systems and interfaces to enable secure, encrypted communications.
Threat/Risk Mitigated
: Without SSL encryption, data transmitted between systems and users is vulnerable to interception, manipulation, or theft via man-in-the-middle attacks. SSL certificates authenticate the systems and encrypt data in transit, preventing unauthorized access to sensitive information and ensuring communication integrity. This addition strengthens the overall security posture by protecting data exchanges, especially for systems managing guest check-in or handling sensitive information.
Regular Patching
Control
: Ensure that Resort Tools systems are updated regularly with security patches.
Threat/Risk Mitigated
: Outdated software can have unpatched vulnerabilities that expose systems to exploits and malware. Regular patching addresses known security issues, reducing the risk of successful attacks and enhancing the resilience of ResortTools systems against emerging threats.

Orders Creation in SWEB from RTP Sales Transactions

Ongoing Support and Maintenance
This solution supports the use of the SKIDATA Skiosk to print media from an RTP order or sales transaction.  Sales that contain deferred printable media from RTP are uploaded to SKIDATA’s SWEB tool which can then be printed on the Skiosk.  Once printed, SKIDATA sends the RFID back to RTP and marks the media as printed.  The media can then be used for validation in RTP.
Solution Overview
There are 4 main aspects to this solution.  1) SKIDATA DTA/SWEB, 2) Unity Contractor Service, 3) Unity DTA Jobs, and 4) RTP.
Open image-20230425-162904.png
SKIDATA DTA/SWEB
SKIDATA provides access to SWEB during the implementation and will also provide training on the tool.  Typically SWEB is accessed often during the initial implementation phase to verify interfaced products and orders but then less after go-live.  The interface between Aspenware and SKIDATA only uses a small portion of SWEB which is also used with SKIDATAs POS and parking system.
SKIDTA Skiosks
This is the hardware that prints RFID cards (shown above).
DTA
This is the name of the interface used by a 3rd party system to interact with SKIDATA’s system.
SWEB
SWEB is the name of the user interface used by the SKIDATA Skiosks and can be used to view interfaced products and orders.  The printing template the Skiosks use is also defined in SWEB.
Open image-20230425-181722.png
Unity Contactor Service
The Unity Contractor Service is an Aspenware-created Windows IIS application that is installed locally at the resort. The application is used for for 2 purposes which are to create products in SKIDATA’s SWEB application (via the catalog import function) and to upload the RFID from the Skiosk back into RTP and to mark the media as printed.
An RTP Client Code is defined in the SKIDATA SWEB tool which is used in the catalog import process to lookup products in RTP that are eligible to be printed on the Skoisk.  A product is created in SWEB for each RTP product and a mapping is automatically defined to the RTP product header code.  Only products that are interfaced to SWEB through the catalog import process are then eligible to printed on the Skiosks.  Once printed, SWEB sends the RFID back to the Unity Contractor Service where it is uploaded into RTP’s ExternalAccessMap table and the media is marked as printed in the TransactionProductOutput table.
Unity DTA Jobs
The Unity DTA Jobs service is also an Aspenware-created Windows IIS application that is installed locally at the resort.  This application polls RTP’s TransactionProductOutput table every minute for new records.  Only transactions with products that have previously been interfaced to SKIDATA’s SWEB tool (via the catalog import) will be picked up by the service and sent to SKIDATA to create an order.  An Order is created in SWEB with a reference to the RTP Sales Transaction ID, Order ID or External Order ID which is used to retrieve the order and print (usually from a QR or barcode).
RTP
RTP sales transactions and fulfilled orders that contain deferred media of season pass and access products are eligible to be printed on the Skiosks.  As mentioned previously, the products must first be included in the catalog import process and interfaced to SWEB before a sales transaction or fulfilled order containing deferred media will be created in SWEB as an Order.
RTP Client Code
The RTP Client Code defined in SWEB will be used by the catalog import to lookup which products meet the criteria to be included in the import process.
Products must be priced in RTP for the day the catalog import runs.
An existing RTP Client Code can be used or a new one can be created.  The Sale Location assigned to the Client in RTP can also be an existing sale location or a new one dedicated to a new Skiosk Location.  The benefit of using a new sale location is that products could be priced for all dates.  If products are only priced for part of the year, it is likely multiple catalog imports will need to be performed in order to interface those products to SWEB making transactions and orders that contain these products eligible to be printed on the Skiosks.  If products are available all season, then it is possible only a single catalog import will need to be run at the beginning of the season.
The Client Code will also be uploaded into several RTP tables as the client code that printed the media (i.e. TransactionProductOutput.OutputClientCode).
Detailed Setup Guide
The following instructions detail the setup steps for using the SKIDATA Skiosk to print media from an RTP order or sales transaction.
Set Up SWEB Contractor
Import SWEB Catalog
Configure SWEB Print Mask (Media Template)
Install Aspenware IIS Application
Test UnityDTAJobs Install
Trigger Sending of RTP Transactions to SKIDATA/SWEB
Select Testing Method
Add Rules to Product Header Codes
Go Live
1. Set Up SWEB Contractor
The Unity Contractor Service URL is define in SWEB which is where SKIDATA will configure a Contractor entry. Aspenware will provide the URL to the Unity Contractor Service once it is setup or will add the URL to SWEB.  This can be found in SWEB in Sales Management / Tenants / Contractors.
Following is an example from Aspenware’s test environment.
Edit the Contractor entry and then navigate to the Contractor System tab to define the URL.

2. Import SWEB Catalog
SKIDATA will configure portions of SWEB prior to the first catalog import.  The catalog import can be found in SWEB in Sales Management > Configuration > Catalogs and there is typically only one entry created for the resort.  The RTP Client Code that will be used to lookup products in RTP is defined in the External ID field (see below).  At least one catalog import will need to be completed prior to any attempt to print from the Skiosks.
Open image-20230425-202054.png
To start the catalog import, click the
Import
button along the top ribbon. Then click
Start Import
.
Open image-20230425-202607.png
2. The import process only takes a few seconds.  To view the products imported, click the Products button along the top ribbon.
Open image-20230425-202713.png
3. If the import was successful, products will show in the list.  Use the gear/settings icon to show the External Id column which shows the RTP Product Header code.
Open image-20230425-202911.png
3. Configure SWEB Print Mask (Media Template)
The catalog import also configures a Print Mask in SWEB which is the media template that prints when a Skiosk order is fulfilled.  This is located in Sales Management > Configuration > Print Masks.  Each time the catalog imports runs, the print mask gets set back to the default which some customers do not use.
It is recommended to define the Print Mask during testing and then to export the template from SWEB and then re-import after each catalog import.
The default template pulls a description from one of the Unity Contractor Service configuration files so this could be used to define a short text line on the template (e.g., Winter 22-23).  Some customers use this and therefore need to remember to update the configuration file after each season.  Each time the configuration file is updated, a catalog import will need to be performed to add the new descriptions to SWEB.  The text is located in the web.config file in the DTA ticketText field.  Additional information can be found on this in the install section of this guide.
Open image-20230425-210309.png
Double click the entry above to edit the template.
Open image-20230425-211351.png
2. To export the template, click
Miscellaneous
in the upper right corner and then the
Export
button.  This will download a JSON file that can be used to import the template using the same method after the next catalog import.

4. Install Aspenware IIS Application
Aspenware will perform 2 installations on Unity in conjunction with this implementation.
Install Unity Contractor Service
Aspenware will install the Unity Contractor Service on a server at the resort that is accessible to the SKIDATA web services.  SKIDATA will provide the IP range of the traffic so that the server can be locked down.  The Unity Contractor Service is an IIS application that is accessed by SKIDATA for the catalog import function and to upload printed RFID’s to RTP.
The following config/json files contain all the configuration values needed for the service.
Rtp-config.json
– contains all RTP configuration values
SalesChannelCode:
Sales channel used for the product catalog import.  Products need to be priced for the day the catalog imports runs and to have output added in RTP for the sales channel defined.
UserID
: This must be a valid user with a valid UserSession.SessionToken in RTP.  This user will be the OperatorID that printed the media in several RTP database tables.
Database Connection string (server, db, SQL user)
: Aspenware will create a new SQL Role and User and the Role needs to have privileges to the following tables.  Aspenware can configure this in SSMS or provide a script.
GRANT SELECT ON  [dbo].[TransactionProductOutput] TO [awdtarole]
GRANT UPDATE ON  [dbo].[TransactionProductOutput] TO [awdtarole]
GRANT SELECT ON  [dbo].[TransactionLineOriginalTransactionLine] TO [awdtarole]

GRANT SELECT ON  [dbo].[AccessDailySummary] TO [awdtarole]
ClientCode
: Client code used for product catalog import.
SaleLocationCode
: Sale location used for the product catalog import.
AuditLocationCod
e: Not used but set to the same location code above.
Web.config
– contains additional setup data
Skiosks:
Defines mapping for SKIDATA Skiosk and RTP Client code.  This client code will be updated in RTP’s TransactionProductOutput.OutputClientCode column as the client that printed the output and shows in various places in RTP.  Currently on a single mapping is supported by SKIDATA.  Define the SKIDATA Sales Channel name to map to the RTP client code in this section.
Open image-20230502-153258.png
ticketText:
Text data is imported during catalog import to SWEB/Print Mask, ‘Text Print Mask Item 1’. If text is changed directly in SWEB, data will be overwritten with text defined in web.config in next catalog import.  If this media element is not added to the Print Mask in SWEB, there is no need to update this from season to season.
priceCategoryName:
Text data is imported during catalog import to SWEB/Price Category.  This description does not show during fulfillment but does show in SKIDATA admin.  Typically this description is set to match the same description of ticketText above.
seasonStartDate
&
seasonEndDate:
Dates are imported during catalog import to SWEB/Time Periods.  Aspenware recommends defining a large data range to avoid having to update each season since this data only shows in SKIDATA admin.
Open image-20230502-153419.png
Test the Unity Contractor Service install by entering the URL into a browser to verify a service page displays instead of an error page.
Example of URL:
https://aspenware.com/UnityContractorService/ContractorService.svc
Install Unity DTA Jobs
Aspenware will install the Unity DTA Jobs on a server at the resort that is accessible to the SKIDATA DTA web services.  SKIDATA will provide the IP range of the traffic so that the server can be locked down.  The Unity DTA Jobs is an IIS application that is used to look up transactions in RTP that have deferred output and to create orders in SKIDATA’s SWEB application.  Microsoft’s dotnet-hosting will also need to be installed on the server hosting the UnityDTAJobs application.
The UnityDTA Jobs service uses Hangfire which is a 3rd party product used to perform background processing in .NET and .NET Core applications.  Hangfire has several database tables that will also need to be deployed which are described below.
Install UnityDTAJobs database
Aspenware has scripts to install the UnityDTAJobs database which also include database tables for Hangfire.  These tables track which RTP transactions have been sent to SKIDATA/SWEB.  See below for screenshot of the tables included in the UnityDTAJobs database.
Open image-20230509-145344.png
Configure UnityDTAJobs
The following config/json files contain all the configuration values needed for the UnityDTAJobs service.
appsettings.json
Used to define database connection info to the Hangfire database tables.
DBConnString:
Define server and database hosting Hangfire database tables.
SyncReservationsBatchSize:
Defines the batch size for syncing RTP transactions to SWEB.  Default is 100.
SyncReturnsBatchSize:
Defines the batch size for syncing RTP return transactions to SWEB which cancel a previously created order.  Default is 100.
SyncPrintUpdatesBatchSize:
Defines the batch size for syncing print updates.  Default is 100.
EmailSettings:
Used to define SMTP email server info for alerts when an error occurs syncing RTP transactions or cancellations to SKIDATA.
skidata-config.json:
Defines SKIDATA production URL’s for the DTA interface.  Typically these do not change.
Client:
Define the SKIDATA DTA Tenant (from SWEB)
WorkingClientName:
Define the SKIDATA Sales Channel Name (from SWEB)
PointofSaleName:

UserID:
This must be a valid user with a valid UserSession.SessionToken in RTP.  This user will be added to transactions that have been interfaced to SKIDATA SWEB.
Database Connection string (server, db, SQL user):
Aspenware creates a new SQL Role and User and the Role needs to have SELECT privileges to the following tables.  Aspenware can configure this in SSMS or provide a script.
GRANT SELECT ON  [dbo].[TransactionProductOutput] TO [awdtarole]
GRANT UPDATE ON  [dbo].[TransactionProductOutput] TO [awdtarole]

5. Test UnityDTAJobs Install
Once installed, navigate to
http://localhost/UnityDTAJobs/hangfire/
in a browser on the machine hosting the application.  If the install was successful, the Hangfire Dashboard should show rather than an error page.  The Realtime Graph below shows the number of transactions processed and the History Graph shows the total uptime of the Hangfire service.
Open image-20230502-183550.png
6. Trigger Sending RTP Transactions to SKIDATA/SWEB
The UnityDTAJobs IIS application uses the dta.LastProcessedTransaction table to track the transactions that have already been sent to SKIDATA.  During the implementation, the ProcessDate will be set to a date in the past and will begin processing once the IIS application is started.  Once the date catches up to the current date, only new transactions containing deferred output will be processed moving forward.
Open image-20230502-184200.png
Every RTP transaction is reviewed by the service to see if there is any deferred output that meets the criteria to be sent to SKIDATA to create an order.  The criteria is that the product in the transaction has been previously interfaced to SKIDATA using the product catalog import and that the product has the Rule, ‘Skidata Print PUB’ added (See rules information below).  Each RTP transaction ID that meets the criteria, will be created in SWEB as an Order and the DTAOrderID will be recorded in the dta.Reservation table.
Open image-20230502-184402.png
The DTAOrderID will also be updated into RTP’s TransactionHeader table in the OfflineTransactionID field.
Open image-20230509-150511.png
Below shows an Order in SWEB created from RTP Transaction ID, 101525809.  If the order originated from an Aspenware online order, the ConfirmationNumber will be the RTP ExternalOrderID (i.e. PK12345).
Open image-20230502-184727.png
7. Select Testing Method
It is possible to point all the services to RTPOneTest to perform testing but it is easier to test against RTPOne prod instead.  The main issue with using RTPOneTest is that SKIDATA does not have a test system so it’s possible that an RTP TransactionID that was interfaced to SKIDATA/SWEB during testing from RTPOneTest will exist in RTPOne production as a real customer’s TransactionID.  The SKIDATA development team can clear out orders that were created during testing but using the method below against RTPOne prod is preferred for testing.
Below is an outline to perform initial testing without interfacing all RTP transactions to SKIDATA SWEB.
Set the dta.LastProcessedTransaction table to have a ProcessDate of today for all rows.
Recycle the UnityDTAJobs application pool (or start the service).
Create or clone an RTP Product Header that contains media output that has never been sold to a customer and add all three Skiosk related Rules (Unity Attribute - Age, Unity Attribute - Duration, and SkiData Print on PUB).
In SKIDATA SWEB, start the product catalog import and verify the new product shows up
If no product, review the SWEB DTA Transaction Logs for any errors.
If no errors in DTA Transaction Logs, review the UnityContractorService log
If no errors in the UnityContractorService log, start SQL trace to see call hitting RTP and manually run in SSMS.  This may reveal that the product does not meet the criteria to be interfaced (pricing, sales channel, sale location, etc).
In RTP, create a sales transaction and sell the product created in step 1 above.  Make sure to defer media during the sale.
In SWEB, make sure you see an Order show up within a minute or two.
If no order in SWEB, verify the UnityDTAJobs IIS application is running (verify the application pool is started).
If UnityDTAJobs is running, check error log.
If no errors, verify there is deferred output in RTP’s Deferred Output Tool.
Check the UnityDTAJobs table, dta.Reservation for the most recent entries to see if there are errors.
Create a barcode or QR code of the RTP TransactionID and attempt to use at Skiosk.
If nothing prints, re-verify the Transactions is in SWEB as an Order
If Order exists but nothing prints, ask SKIDATA to check the Skiosk log (which is located directly on the PC inside the Skiosk hardware.
If media prints, verify the RFID can be used to perform a search in RTP.
If RFID cannot be searched successfully in RTP, look for errors in the UnityContractorService log.
Repeat steps above for an RTP OrderID that is manually created and fulfilled in RTP and for an online order.
For an Order created directly in RTP, use the RTP OrderID as the barcode/QR code at the Skiosk.
For an online order, use the RTP ExternalOrderID as the barcode/QR code at the Skiosk.
8. Add Rules to Product Header Code(s)
Three Product Header Rules need to be added to any product that will be printed from the Skiosk.
IMPORTANT
:
DO NOT ADD THESE RULES UNTIL GO-LIVE.
More info on this can be found in the testing section of this document below.
Rule 1: Unity Attribute - Duration
Add Duration rule to Product Header Codes per the diagram and define a value of 1.
Open image-20230613-212505.png
Duration Rule
Rule 2: Unity Attribute - Age
Add Age rule to Product Header Codes per the diagram and define a value of 1.
Open image-20230613-212816.png
Age Rule
Rule 3: SkiData Print on PUB
Add SkiData Print on PUB Rule to Product Header Codes and define a value of TRUE.
Open image-20230613-213139.png
SKIDATA Print on PUB Rule
Open image-20230425-182209.png
Example of Rules added to PHC
Configure Product components to have Output and to Allow Deferral.
NOTE
: If after go-live, the resort realizes they did not add the three Rules to all products, the catalog import can be run again and the ProcessDate in the dta.LastProcessedTransaction can be set back to a date in the past.  The service will run and skip over any transaction it has already processed and only create orders in SWEB for transactions containing the new products.  This process will also take a few hours because every transaction is reviewed again by the service.
9. Go Live
Going live with the Skiosks means ensuring all products in RTP have the three rules added and then setting the ProcessDate in the dta.LastProcessedTransaction to a date in the past.  If the testing method above was followed, there should be no need to clear out data in the dta.Reservation table.
Stop the UnityDTAJobs application pool.
Ensure the 3 product header rules have been added to all products.
(SEE SECTION ABOVE)
Start the product catalog import in SWEB
Ask the resort to review the list of products.  If products are missing, ask the resort to add the three Rules to additional products and/or verify the product(s) are priced for ‘today'.
Repeat this step until the resort verifies all products are showing in SWEB.
Set the dta.LastProcessedTransaction table to have a ProcessDate in the past.  This should be the date of or right before the date they started selling media products for the season.
Start the UnityDTAJobs application pool.
Verify Orders are showing in SKIDATA SWEB.  This process can take a few hours depending on how far back the date goes and how many total transaction's the resort has.
To verify the initial load of Orders is complete, verify the ProcessDate for the Reservation column now shows today’s date.
Orders Creation in SWEB from RTP Sales Transactions
The Unity DTA Service is always running in the customer’s environment and is looking for new RTP transactions that contain deferred pass media and access output.  The products in these transactions need to have the Product Header Rule, SkiData Print On PUB and the products must currently be in SWEB from a catalog import.  If all these conditions are met, an Order gets created in SWEB which can be viewed in Sales Management > Monitoring > Orders (see below).  Once the Order is created in SWEB, it can then be printed from the Skiosk.
If an order or is cancelled in RTP or the fulfillment transactions has been returned, the order is then cancelled in SKIDATA/SWEB and cannot be printed.
The ‘Confirmation Number’ that appears in SWEB will be the RTP Sales Transaction ID if the deferred output is associated with an RTP sales transaction (completed directly in RTP), an RTP OrderID if the deferred output originated from an RTP order (completed directly in  RTP), or the ExternalOrderID if the sale originated from an Aspenware order (or any 3rd party processing orders into RTP).
This is the only value mapped to the SKIDATA Order and is the only value that can be used to find and print the order on the Skiosk.
In other words, for an Aspenware order, only the ExternalOrderID will get mapped to the Order in SWEB so only that value can be used to find the order and print the media from the Skiosk.  The RTP OrderID from Aspenware’s order cannot be used to find the order in SWEB.
Open image-20230425-223635.png
Ongoing Support and Maintenance
Depending on the products being printed on the Skiosks, additional product catalog imports may need to be run in the future.  Some resorts have very few products that haven’t changed from year to year so they may have only used the catalog import function during the initial implementation.  Resorts that are not bundling media with access on product headers may have very few media product headers and therefore very few interfaced products in SKIDATA/SWEB.  Resorts that bundle media and access may have dozens or hundreds of products interfaced to SKIDATA/SWEB.
The key thing to remember is that ‘todays’ date is used when the catalog import runs so if a resort does not have pricing setup until their opening date (i.e. 11/15/2024), then running the catalog import in October will not interface products to SKIDATA/SWEB.
As mentioned above, each time the catalog import is run in SWEB, the Print Mask resets back to the default so if the resort isn’t using the default, they will need to import the Print Mask file after each import.

The Aspenware Scanning application integrates into RTP’s access control system and can be used to process online and offline scans.  The application runs on handheld devices running Android kitkat up to version 11 of Android  (version 4.4 to version 11) which also have the DataWedge application (typically Zebra devices).  The devices connect via http or https to a server within the resorts internal local area network (LAN) running Aspenware’s Unity API.  Unity then communicates to the RTP database on the resorts LAN to verify scanning data and retrieve customer information.  The Unity API can be installed on the existing RTP application server or on another server located within the resort’s LAN.
The devices should be configured on the resorts local area network (LAN) and not a through a public wireless access point.  The devices should not have access to the internet, and it is the resorts responsibility to secure access to the scanner data and network traffic.  It is also recommended to disable Bluetooth and any cellular networks on the device.
There are 3 main aspects of this solution, 1) Android Device (AWScanning.apk), 2) Unity, and 3) RTP
Open image-20210512-191746.png
Settings Overview
The Aspenware Scanning application settings allow configuring the device behavior on the Login page and when scanning barcodes and reading RFID media cards.  The Login page can be configured to require scanning barcodes/RFID cards in order to sign-in as well as to require the user of a valid RTP UserID.  To gain access to the device settings, manually enter or scan a barcode of the word, ‘SETTINGS’.  This will automatically display the settings page on the device.
Open image-20210512-191826.png

Web Service
– defines connectivity information for the device to connect to Unity.
Device
– defines DeviceID as well as behavior of the Login page.  See below for more info on each setting.
Sound Settings
– defines sound and vibration settings for offline, validate only and live  scans.  See below for more info on sound settings.
UHF Scan Settings
– only displays on a device that is configured to use UHF.  These settings control the default trigger mode, range of the UHF reader and RFID conversion type.  See below for more info on each setting.
Settings - Web Service
Open image-20210512-192136.png
The web service URL must be entered in the following format including the trailing slash:  https://<servername>/Unity/ (i.e.
https://aspenwarecommerce.net/UnityProd/
)
Client Id – defined during implementation. Do not change.
Client Secret – defined during implementation. Do not change.
Settings - Device Settings
The login page is configurable through Device Settings to allow the following options.
Open image-20210512-192223.png
Device ID
– defines the ID used to record scans in RTP.  Recommend defining a unique Device ID per device.
Require Location Scan
– determines whether user can manually select Access Location or if scanning a barcode is required to sign-in.  If set to Y, user must scan a valid AccessLocationCode from RTP (i.e barcode of 100, 110, 120, etc.)
Validate UserID
– determines whether username is a validated against RTP.  If enabled, a valid RTP UserID must be used to sign-in.
Force Login Scan
– determines whether a user must scan a pass media barcode or read an RFID card to sign-in.  If enabled, the RTP IPCode the pass belongs to must be added to a UserID in Admin/Security Administration/User in RTP:
Open image-20210512-192321.png
Enable Add Customer ID
–enables functionality to allow operator to enter an RTP Customer ID (IPCode) when a certain RTP Access Error is returned as a scan result.  After entering customer ID, a new scan will be triggered that appends the {CustomerID} to the end of the previously scanned code.
Customer ID Scan Code –
click to enter a specific RTP Access Error ‘Error Message’ for the Enable Add Customer ID functionality.  This will be the only RTP Access Error that will trigger this functionality to allow an operator to enter a Customer ID (IPCode).  For example, ‘Bad Type’ is entered below so when this scan result is returned to the scanner, the ‘Add Customer ID’ option will display allowing the operator to enter an RTP IPCode.

Settings - Sound Settings
Sound settings define the sound generated for an Offline, Validate Only and Live Scan on the device.  Several sounds are delivered in each category and custom sounds can also be uploaded as of v1.14 of the app.  You can also define whether the device vibrates with each type of sound by checking the Vibrate checkbox.
For Live Scans, ‘Beep’ settings are used to map to valid and invalid scans from RTP Access Rule Product Type administration.  Settings for 1 and 3 Beeps are delivered with the device and map to a valid and invalid scan from RTP (3 is always an invalid scan in RTP).  Additional Beeps can be added which map to RTP’s Access Rule Product Type administration entries.  To add new Beeps, click the ‘New Setting’ button below and define an un-used Beep Count, Sound and Vibrate setting.  ‘4 Beeps’ has been added in the screen shot below.  After adding a new setting, you must click the ‘Save Settings’ button.

To upload custom sounds
, place a .wav file in the devices Notification directory and select the custom sound file when defining new beeps or when editing the Offline and/or Validate Only settings.  For example, in the screen shots below, the ‘LightningSound.wav’ was uploaded to the device making it available to select through the app.

Trigger Mode
Barcode and RFID – allows the scanner to scan barcodes and read RFID tags.  When this is enabled, a barcode will be read first even if an RFID tag is in range.
RFID Only – only allows the scanner to scan RFID tags.
Use Max Transmit Power
– impacts the range of the scanner.  When enabled, the max range of the device will be used to scan RFID tags.  The max range for the Zebra MC3300 is 270 but this can differ per device.  This value is a numeric value that relates to a dBm value (decibels with reference to one milliwatt.)  The Zebra MC3300 has a range of 0-30 dBm so a value of 270 is equivalent to 30 dBM.
Transmit Power
– used when Use Max Transmit Power is disabled and defines transmit power other than the max value.  It is likely that this setting will need to be adjusted for each customer to find the optimal setting.  A lower value (i.e. 30 or 50) makes it easier to scan a specific tag while a higher value allows reading tags from greater distances.
Set Tag Population
– enabled or disabled.
Tag Population
– if Set Tag Population is enabled, this value defines the estimated number of tags that will be in range of the scanner.
Convert IDs to Base 32
– enabled or disabled
If enabled, Id is converted to Base 32 (i.e. 1OG000B706016C1N1R02)
If disabled, Id is Base 16 (i.e. E28068900000000163F009B9)
Use TID Memory Bank
– enables the application to use the value stored in the TID memory bank instead of the default tagId.  Typically ‘Convert IDs to Base 32’ is also selected when this is enabled.
Use EPC Memory Bank
– enables the application to use the value stored in the EPC memory bank instead of the default tagId.  Typically ‘Convert IDs to Base 32’ is also selected when this is enabled.
Login Page
Based on how Login Settings are defined, the login page will appear with various options.

Offline Mode
The application will automatically go into Offline mode when connectivity to the Unity server is not available.  A unique offline sound will occur for each scan.  Offline scans will accumulate until the device is back online and scans will automatically be uploaded in the back-ground while not interfering with new online scans.
It is possible to login to the device when in offline mode.  The list of Access Locations on the login page is cached on the device allowing users to select locations before logging in.  It is not possible to login while in offline mode if the Device Setting, ‘Validate UserID’ is enabled.

Resort Tools - Kiosk
is designed for guests to complete the required information at a resort kiosk
Our user-facing kiosk is designed to capture required information in your rental stores, pass offices and lesson locations

All guests at a particular location will be guided through the same process, which is optimized for that location. The product can operate without an internet connection if configured for offline use. Guests can use a fast-flow option with pre-filled information, but personalization based on guest data and order details is unavailable. If personalization is important,
