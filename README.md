### What is this NLP for?

At Snowbird, there is tons of documentation scattered in various systems for important resort technologies. 

Since there are many verticals and teams at a ski resort, much of this documentation is needed quickly.

A ski resort is - in essence - a small city. There are retail stores, construction crews, fire departments, restaurants, hotels, etc.

With each of these verticals, there are various SOPs that get tossed around... and forgotten.

The problem? Time spent looking for answers, tickets sitting in queues longer, emails and teams messages marinating while ops are impacted.

TLDR: when technology works, it's great. When technology doesn't work, it's terrible. Worse even, when you can't find the answers you need - and fast.

### What does this bot fix?

RTPGPT aka Archie aims to fix the issue of scattered documentation in folders, teams channels, old systems, legacy platforms, into one chatbot that anyone can ask for help - with only the ability to speak english as a prerequisite!

No matter if the user is in retail, ski patrol, hospitality or any of the many verticals at a ski resort - they can get their answers as if they had an expert on resort systems in their pocket.
